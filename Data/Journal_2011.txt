Got Buffer.write and Buffer.read working.  probe test in TestBufferedAvlTree
	creates a valid AVL tree, stores it in buffer, writes it out,
	then reads it in.
	***TODO*** Buffer contents really not being used.  Upon initing
	buffer need to have logic so that the root gets set after creating the
	tree.  Where should I store the root and other stuff?  Before I stored
	it in the associator.  Perhaps should create one here.  Root, sizes,
	etc. are all stored there.

Need to rethink buffers.  0th buffer should be the location of system data
	including the loc of the root node, block size, etc.
	Then in get Buffer we always add one to the block number.
	i.e. 0 block becomes 1, 1 becomes 2, etc.
	In memory. buffer #, space-used, dirty-flag, ref-count.  Blocks are padded to the block-size ( e.g. 1024 or 2048 or 4096 ).
	Each read of a block (buffer) in memory adds to the ref-count.
	What decrements the count?
	When a block is needed but isn't in memory, the lowest ref-count block
	is replaced with the needed block.
	When a block is updated, it is queued to be written out by an asynchronous task.  How to handle another update before the block is actually written?  What about freeing up a buffer but the block has not been written?

Think through the sequence to delete a node.  Seems like this would leave
	a gap in the middle of a block.  Changing a value from DDD to DDDD would entail deleting the DDD node and inserting the DDDD node.  A node can be inserted in any block that has available space.

Should I store the offset in the block or just a sequence number, then each node has a sequence # followed by its length.  That way nodes can be moved up in the block when one is deleted and the space freed up at the end.

Each "database" consists of the set of blocks written out.  The zero-th block also contains the next-isn to use for identifying nodes.

Closed demo-code after integrating in axis libs, hibernate libs, others from article.  Not easy to see how this works as it is pretty incomplete, but perhaps
could refactor my Action classes so that they use a Service Oriented approach, viz:

Examine ServiceRouter.java:

   public Object route(ServiceRequest serviceRequest) throws Exception {


      //        /1. Read all the mapping from XML file or retrieve it from Factory
      //         Config config = xxxx;

      //        2. Get service's type from config.
      String businessServiceType = Config.getBusinessServiceType(serviceRequest.getServiceName());

      //        3. Select the corresponding Router/Handler/Controller to deal with it.

      if (businessServiceType.equalsIgnoreCase("LOCAL-POJO")) {

         POJOController pojoController = (POJOController) Config.getBean("POJOController");

         pojoController.process(serviceRequest);
      }
      else if (businessServiceType.equalsIgnoreCase("WebServices")) {

         String endpoint = Config.getWebServiceEndpoint(serviceRequest.getServiceName());

         WebServicesController ws = (WebServicesController) Config.getBean("WebServicesController");

         ws.setEndpointUrl(endpoint);
         ws.process(serviceRequest);
      }
      else if (businessServiceType.equalsIgnoreCase("EJB")) {
         EJBController ejbController = (EJBController) Config.getBean("EJBController");
         ejbController.process(serviceRequest);

      }
      else {
         //TODO
         System.out.println("Unknown types, it's up to you how to handle it in the framework");
      }
      //        That's it, it is your framework, you can add any new ServiceProvider for your next project.

      return null;

   }

The config file (x18p-config.xml) contains:

<services>
<service name="User Services" type="POJO" sprintObjectId="userServiceManager"/>
<service name="Legacy Services" type="CORBA-services" />
<service name="Payment Services" type="EJB" />
<service name="Other Services 1" type="WebServices" webServicesEndpoint="http://localhost:7777/yof/services/LookupWebService"/>
�
</services>

another Sprint configuration file (applicationContext.xml) contains:

<beans>
	<bean id="businessServiceRequest" class="x18p.framework.service.ServiceRwquest" singleton="false"/>
<bean id="serviceRouter" class="x18p.framework.service.ServiceRouter" singleton="true" />
</beans>

Downloaded source code that should run under glass fish and put it under Development/glassfish.  Study this.  It should do a simple ordering application using EJB3, etc.

Also moved sprint-framework, hypername, axis, ejb, and code expamples under Development/Applications.  Need to study more.

Review what is in NetBeans.
I seem to have java 1.6 installed.  What else do I need to
	have to run examples in JEE Book?
Try to create and use an EJB for User or such.
Try to use a Restful service to access the EJB
Refactor login servlet so that it uses that Restful service
	and removes all logic of initializing, etc. and puts
	it in a configurable class.
Do some work on the Entity classes and see if they and all data actions
	can be put behind another configurable level.
	e.g. Configuration controls what class is called to handle
		getting a table or a queue item, etc.
	Then all actions get the appropriate class and use standard
	methods to get the results.  More decoupling!
	Actions don't know about the user objects, databases, etc.

Downloaded and installed Eclipse Helios (3.6), then set some preferences like line numbers in editors.  Named it Eclipse_3.6 in ~woo/Development/Applications.
Did an update in Help window of Helios and updated the version of Helios up to Version: Helios Service Release 2 Build id: 20110218-0911.
Downloaded book "Beginning Java EE 6 with GlassFish 3" source code into
	workspaces as "Beginn�."
Downloaded and installed Derby 1.5 and Eclipse plugins from db.apache.org/derby.  Unzipped and drug ui and ui.doc (2) folders into Eclipse plugins directory and restarted.  Brought up help and the Derby Help documentation was there.
Looked up repository name for Maven 2 at http://maven.apache.org and
	added it as a repository to Help, install new software.  Maven
	now appears as a view.  Will try to create project soon.

Created project by copying in Chapter02 from Java EE book.  Did run as Maven:test and it ran.  Gave exception about dropping BOOK table but worked fine otherwise.
Tried to start the network server and got that working.  Found that I had dropped the plugin for core in wrong.  Restarted and found the Derby menu items.
Then started server.  Got permission error.  After a lot of searching found that
if I added:

	// Added for Derby access
	permission java.io.FilePermission "${user.dir}${/}derby.log", "read,write,delete";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.home", "read";
        permission java.io.FilePermission "${user.home}${/}*", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.dir", "read";
};


***TODO*** Review whether any of this is necessary!

to the java.policy under JAVA_HOME/security, that it started and running
Main.java as an application also worked except for same DROP BOOK error.

Cannot connect 'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/chapter02DB'; and get the connection to work.  I get another file permission about a service.properties
in a directory that I don't have.   Sent email to author to see why I'm getting these errors.

Got derby to work with embedded using url of
	connect 'jdbc:derby:/Users/woo/temp/derby/chapter02DB';
     This works fine and can then be explored by cd'ing to
	~/Development/Applications/db-derby-10.7.1.1-bin/bin and typing
	ij
	then connect and then select * from BOOK;
	then quit

Found suggestions on what to pack for painting

MISCELLANEOUS

Paper Towels - We are all concerned about ecology and don�t like using paper products unnecessarily. However, no matter how hard I have tried, I find that rags do not absorb oil paint adequately. Within minutes into a painting, the cloth is saturated and my hands are covered with paint! I use Viva paper towels and no, I don�t have stock in the company! They are however, the only really good paper towel to use because they are really absorbent. I end up using much less of them than any other cheaper towel which helps alleviate my guilt about using them!

Litter - I save plastic bags from the A&P or small brown paper bags for my used paper towels. They can easily be tucked into a pocket or my easel, allowing me to leave the location as clean as I found it.

Mirror - A hand mirror is useful for giving you a new point of view of your painting. When we work, our eyes get used to the painted image, and it is hard to see areas or colors that need adjustment. By looking at your painting in reverse, you see in with a fresh perspective and can make necessary changes before it is too late.

The Sun - Sun screen or lotion is a must if you�re not used to working outdoors. Even if you are, the sun on Cape Cod in the summer can be more intense than in other parts of the country. Try to avoid wearing sunglasses when you paint unless they are a neutral gray. If you work with even slightly colored glasses, the only way a viewer can objectively look at your painting is by wearing the same glasses. A broad brimmed hat or a sun visor is a better solution and is an absolute must when painting outdoors.

Bugs - Insect repellent can prevent a lot of annoyance!

Notepad - I do demonstrations and offer a great deal of information during the workshop. Please feel free to bring notepads for note-taking, and cameras if you wish to photograph the demos.

Painting Clothes - When deciding what to wear, avoid bright colored shirts, jackets and sweaters. They reflect into your wet painting, (especially on sunny days) and can make accurate color mixing difficult. Gray or neutral colors minimize this problem. And once again, don�t forget a hat or sun-visor!

Another list of supplies:

        Portable easel (French easel, half easel, pochade box or something appropriate for outdoor use)

        Container for washing brushes (Holbein brush cleaner, Silicoil jar, or something similar)

        Gamsol or Turpenoid

        Portable palette (appropriate for outdoor use)

        Paper towels and a small trash bag

        Sketch book and pencils

        Natural bristle brushes: Flats 2, 4 and 6 (at least 2 each)

        Palette knife

        Small Pocket mirror

        Recommended Paints: I usually buy my paints and supplies, except easels, at Utrecht (800-223-9132) for catalog and store locations

        Colors: Cadmium Yellow Pale, Light; Cadmium Orange; Yellow Ochre; Cadmium Red Light; Pthalo Red Rose or Quinacradone Rose (or something close); Alizarin Crimson (optional); Ultramarine Blue and/or Cobalt Blue; Cerulean Blue Hue; Viridian; Ivory Black; Titanium white (large tube); Burnt Umber; Sap Green

        Any specialty colors you like. If you�re more comfortable with certain colors than what I have listed here, that�s fine; I do recommend a range of colors and not just a limited palette.

        Panels: Assortment of canvas boards, 12x16 up to 16 x 20 (Four per day; cotton or linen)

        Water, sunscreen and a hat

        Camera (optional)

        Portable Chair (optional)

   Umbrella (optional)

Note the list of rationales available in Viewer.

These now need to be put into the user prefs viewer and saved, etc.  They are examined in the IOV reader
to see which ones get added to the concept network.  Those are the available ones and the user preferences will contain
the selected ones which get set into the IOV reader (or accessed from user prefs).

Create addition to user prefs

Add Auto Save for Review and Auto Redact to scan panel ( check an ini flag to see if allowed ).  Watch unviewed pages check.

Create a task to redact selected files in scan list.

What about directory where to put?  Pops up when click Auto Save or Auto Redact.

Look at counting add pages when txt, check initializes right.

Look at accounting module.  It prints prints out monthly in accounting folder YYYYMM.invoice with date, mac id, number
	of pages processed, invoiced amount and md5 code to prevent it getting altered.  It must be mailed to us.  What if it isn't?
	We protest, then at next renewal, it doesn't work anymore because it has no valid key.  Key is for one year.

Look at handling license with mac address and registration.  Create hashed registration key.  Send to us, decrypt
	send back registration key to paste in.  Without registration key that matches mac address app won't run.

Updated Growl
#33


---20110607  4:38:04 PM

Updated ClassMetrics.
	a)  The jar file containing the classes to be examined need to be
		in the path.  Use the build path to add library areteq.jar
		to the path.
	b)  The projects.config contains info on what to examine or omit.
	c)  Need to add browser buttons to the Viewer to make it easier.
	d)  Need to add ability to set the jar file in the viewer for flexibility.
	e)  Use the classpath reader(?) to read from the jar.

	My changes may have affected its use with sc_workspace as I used some stuff from redaction.  I'm going to copy those into ClassMetrics so that it
	can stand alone. ( or create a jar of foundation and put it in the ClassMetrics as a library ).

2006 notes had good Entity structure.  review it and change Entity
	to use it.  It looks like it will nest deeper.

	oid, variable_name, type, [value/oid]  - type can be string, int, float,
		date, class, map

	e.g.  Entities

	001,101,Person,Class,102
	002,102,Last Name, string
	003,102,First Name, string
	004,102,Address,Class,104

	006,104,City,string
	007,104,State,string
	008,104,Zip,string

	e.g. Instances

	100,102,002,Wooten

Updated nyc under Tomcat 4.1.31 so that images, metrics, changeRequests, and errors seem to show.  Haven't added the part for editing those after they are added or deleting them.  This is an example of a management panel.  It needs to
build the summary and other panels automatically.

Added the nyc to dropbox so that when we drag it there it will keep a backup.

Need to review the Entity managmeent given the above notes.


---20110617  2:39:31 PM

Added EditProject to nyc so that the project values could be entered and
	edited.  Goal is so that budget for instance goes down.  Depending
	upon the schedule begin and end date, if the budget is not going
	right, then we will show that in yellow or red, etc.  Each of the items
	needs a criteria of what the numbers mean and come from.  Quality can
	be some count of different bug types combined, technical can be design
	parts, personnel a measure of retention, etc.
TODO - make the Home page graph come from the data.
Project selector on upper right or left.
Schedule Page uses and adds data to the project schedule table.
Metrics gets some data from project page also.
Errors, Risks, and Change Requests also interact with Project table.
Put all into drop box again.

changed part of the filter display in Viewer but now it doesn't use the
	filter list the first pass ( i.e. as if un-selected ),

	analysis which shows the values to be used.
	BUT, if you de-select email, for instance, then OK, it reanalyzes
	without email as desired, but redisplays the filter list with it selected.
	Track down the sequence here and whether a different list is being used.
	Also look into saving the list in the user data for the next

Preparing to update WordPress.
Logged into phpMyAdmin using root/root (admin and password of mysql)
Followed instruction in WordPress to do the backup
The database name for wordpress was in wp-config.php and was blog
Created blog_db.sql.zip following wordpress instructions.
When clicked "Go" it created file in Downloads.
Will save those where it can be included in routine TimeMachine backups.
Created directory under ~woo called Archive where I put this.
Downloaded latest WordPress 2.1 zip file.  Put on desktop.
Instructions:
Step 1: Replace WordPress files

    Get the latest WordPress zip (or tar.gz) file.
    Unpack the zip file that you downloaded.
    Delete the old wp-includes and wp-admin directories on your web host (through your FTP or shell access).
    Using FTP or your shell access, upload the new wp-includes and wp-admin directories to your web host, overwriting old files.
    Upload the individual files from the new wp-content folder to your existing wp-content folder, overwriting existing files. Do NOT delete your existing wp-content folder. Do NOT delete any files or folders in your existing wp-content directory (except for the one being overwritten by new files).
    Upload all new loose files from the root directory of the new version to your existing wordpress root directory.

NOTE - you should replace all the old WordPress files with the new ones in the wp-includes and wp-admin directories and sub-directories, and in the root directory (such as index.php, wp-login.php and so on). Don't worry - your wp-config.php will be safe.

Be careful when you come to copying the wp-content directory. You should make sure that you only copy the files from inside this directory, rather than replacing your entire wp-content directory. This is where your themes and plugins live, so you will want to keep them. If you have customized the default or classic themes without renaming them, make sure not to overwrite those files, otherwise you will lose your changes. (Though you might want to compare them for new features or fixes..)

Lastly you should take a look at the wp-config-sample.php file, to see if any new settings have been introduced that you might want to add to your own wp-config.php.
Step 1.5: Remove .maintenance file

If you're upgrading manually after a failed auto-upgrade, delete the file .maintenance from your WordPress directory using FTP. This will remove the "failed update" nag message.
Step 2: Update your installation

Visit your main WordPress admin page at /wp-admin. You may be asked to login again. If a database upgrade is necessary at this point, WordPress will detect it and give you a link to a URL like http://example.com/wordpress/wp-admin/upgrade.php. Follow that link and follow the instructions. This will update your database to be compatible with the latest code. You should do this as soon as possible after step 1.


Got App store to download Install Xcode.app.
Dbl-clicked it and went through install screens.
It completed and said it would start Xcode, WHICH THEN CRASHED!
Did a system restart ( Just in Case )
Starting XCode still caused a crash.  Could not submit crash report as that
	also crashed.
Trying to do Install Xcode again to see if that will help.
VOILA!  Second installation did the trick.  XCode now works AND
	make now works.
Did configure in mktemp directory and it created Makefile.
Then did make install and it worked.
HOWEVER, it apparently made a PowerPC version!  I deleted /usr/bin/mktemp
	and copied the created /usr/local/bin/mktemp to that location, but
	it was still a PowerPC version.  Need to find out how to turn off
	the PowerPC and make it Intel.
Okay, checked that /usr/bin/mktemp was PowerPC version.
found a newer config.guess at /Developer/usr/share/automake-1.10.
copied it into mktemp replacing config.guess
Then did configure followed by make install
Then checked that /usr/local/bin/mktemp --v said it was correct!  It did.
Copied /usr/local/bin/mktemp to /usr/bin/mktemp
Tried mktemp --v and it said it was PowerPC!
Closed terminal window and opened a new one ( rehash apparently isn't there)
Now mktemp --v gives right version and runs.
Running into problems with Parallels not having hardware virtualization.
Importing Windooze_1 into VMWareFusion to test there. ***TODO***
Checked out git download I had done and it doesn't recognize x64 or something.  Needs new configure.guess also, I guess.
Looking at CruiseControl and want to install it.  It appeared to install, now I have to follow through with the Hello World to test.  Will do so.
	***TODO***
did import into cvsrep of helloWorld.  Seemed to go okay.  Now have to
	edit the cvs-build.xml script.

Installation appears to be working.
	a)  MySQL is running and all tables appear fine.
	b)  VMs appear to be working.  A lot of images are on my Passport
		drive.
	c)  NetBeans appears to work as well as XCode.
Setup is as follows:
	a)  Macintosh HD is my internal HD (500Gbytes) and has been
		CCC to T2_500G1 in current state and tested for reboot.
		Macintosh HD is also doing hourly backups to TimeCapsule
		when at home.
	b)  T2_500G1 is the CCC of Macintosh HD with Snow Leopard.  It shares
		the jwooten37839 MobileMe.  It is NOT to be cloned elsewhere.
		When an experiment is to be done.  Macintosh HD is CCC
		to T2_500G1 and the experiment done after booting to T2_500G1
		AND dismounting the other disks as it gets confusing about
		which is the "home" system at the time.
		T2_500G1 is not backed up unless temporarily into T2_1000G.
	c)  T2_500G2 is an installation of Lion with XCode.  Don't believe
		I have tested MySQL there yet.  Appears functional.
		Is not to be cloned to other partition unless to
		T2_1000G for backup while testing.  (See if I can do this
		to a folder there so can keep T2_500G1 backup also).
When testing in SnowLeopard, CCC T2_500G1 into folder on T2_1000G. Then
	be sure Macintosh HD is CCC to T2_500G1.
	Then boot from T2_500G1 and install new software, test lots of things.
		(I need a regression suite!)  ***TODO***
	After satisfied and after Macintosh HD has had TimeCapsule backup,
	CCC T2_500G1 back to Macintosh HD for the working system. If screw up,
	CCC T2_500G1 back from folder in T2_1000G.
	Similarly for Lion.

Brought up Apache Director Studio from Applications.  Added a server ldap_server on localhost.  Had to make the ports 10389 and 10386 open on the LinkSys so I could talk to it.  Forwarded those ports to 192.168.1.110 which
is my machine.  Added information about jdoe as shown in blog.
Tests worked from sc_authenticate except haven't figured out how to check
the password yet.  ***TODO***
Looked at sc_statemachine and verified that it is working.  Need to look at how TestApplication creates a new application, then adds the state machine and then adds the listener a new BPListener.  In that class, it checks for messages and initially saves data, then upon advance re-queues entry and marks other one
completed. ( simulated, of course ).  Now to create a BPQueueListener and in that do the proper things with the state information, then when that is working save the form data that is being carried along in an Entity perhaps?  ***TODO***
create a new project sc_queueListener to handle this.

Kevin Colander?, McKesson, chief architect - discussion about Clinicals, SaaS Relay product.  18 business segments.  technical emeritus, core nucleus of about 200 products in portfolio.  Products(200) each have about 10^6 lines of code.  Runs engineering governance program.  Architecture, security, interoperability, open source, mobility.  Pulling together standards working on go forward path.

Many thick client on-premise.  paragon 2 products, clinical about 25-30 products, relay ? products.  Technical relay

dial into 877-674-2487 #179310

scope today 30 products, tech stacks: relay is mostly MS, .NET, deployed in SaaS over internet.
paragon, 75% in powerbuilder, started rewriting in .NET, MS SQL SERVER database.

clinicals, C++ unix daemon processes, port authority is a singleton process managing daemon processes and messaging.  Starts with an X11 windows rendering engine modified and running off of the singleton.  Order manager, care organizer, EMD tracking board.  building .NET thick clients as executables via SOAP services to java services running on unix servers talking to Oracle.

Portal Vinette portal engine, doesn't scale on load balancer.  Physician portal viewers, 30-40 web pages.

Horizon doc(nursing), health summary, plan(nursering, discharge), notes(note entry).

HEO, expert orders - acquired from Vanderbilt OS2 application, rewrote into C++, web front end?, runs on one screen tiled and poss. desktop version that is C++, nodes/arcs language Gnarl language rules engine.

Collection of Oracle databases some uniformly across products, few have well-defined middle tier, share scheme, tribal knowledge not well documented and walk on each other, lots of CRs and resolutions, very fragile.   Not well architected for clinical suite.

Paragon has own SQL database, fairly well interfaced.  Relay is very well architected, messaging, busing, document exchange hub.

Clinical products do have exchange of Hl7 2.5 interchange, mods to make play together.  Paragon and Relay have HL7 messaging.

Target is 200 bed hospital, radiology, lab, pharmacy.
200 up is Horizon clinicals version.

Paragon scalability.

Next two generate lots of data into "system"
Hor meds mgr. - C++ with no middle tier, lots of stored proc in database.
	sponsored rewrite 3 years ago in Google web front end.
Hor laboratory - not well integrated, sold standalone, 16 bit Delph desktop, ANSII C services, private Oracle DB, HL7. 30 executables, 100s menu item.

Ambulatory care, java ,

26 UIs in .NET for am care.

No standard using LDAP, often proprietary.

databases:

Xwindows, portal, Hdd, meds, clinicals database.
Heo? is own database.
ambulatory own database.
meds manager own database.
lab own database.
tables on physicians, users, etc.  no security technology, etc.
portal has some LDAP, but not usually.

performance limitations on each of these and move to get onto Linux array, but not complete, problematic were on big iron originally.

17 or so descrete technology stacks, not well documented.  Throw army at them to maintain, fragile.  Hard to figure out what to do next.

200 customers for clinical suite.  thick client.  Some do remote hosting.
deployed on customer hardware.

Paragon on prem configuration, some remote using citrix.

Relay runs at McKesson data center fully thin over internet.

Quality needle pegged in the red.

5 years ago would move coding and so forth to India, much back on board after that fiasco.  Loss of brain power due to that.

Staffing levels, 50% maint. versus dev.  compliance.

future in gwt, (med reconcilation..)   in house.. incremental..
technical debt

mobile - dabbling
cloud - relay closest

good bead on consus for tech stacks, challenge is (Randy Sprat?), sharing between legacy/new stacks.

All but clinicals under good source control, clinicals in Star Team, older in ClearCase.  Different branches probably out of control versioning.  Have build master.

Paragon happens out of Charlotte NC, 300+ 100 engineering, rest
Relay out of Emoryville CA, 200+
Clinicals in Westminister CO, 500, 300 r&D,

Some maintained remotely

HHS, RHN, roseille MN, asked to move to Atlanta or Westminister, most will not move.  Maint. jeopardy.  Trying to get colocation.  Roseville aging.

Alpharetta, GA, about 1000 software maint  about 50% dev.
All McKesson 8200 in devel roles.
Some in UK and some in Canada, executive desire for internationalization, but not much progress.

I18N possible in Relay.  Very standards oriented.

Still some outsourcing to India, scaled down.  Some dev to Mexico, but not from these product groups.  Core clinicals outsourced to India, got toasted.

Difficulty in meeting quality and schedules company wide.  Clinical apps have 200 or so 'nerd knobs' and need ability to be "tuned".  Outsourced difficult here as spec-ware too extensive. Code returned far too literal.  Have about 10K automated tests, plus hand testing, but far too few.

Lots of little dev groups all doing their own thing.  Some do regression suites, some do not.  How much tied to code coverage, very few unit tests.

Saturated market, replacement is model, Cerner and Epic competitors.
Replacement market key is to retain base, through meeting meaningful use, and making easier to use and more maintainable.  So ticked off that willing to take multiyear move to another vendor.  Merging causes changes.  Churn in market due to acquisition.  Keep locked in, sell new products and capabilities.  Feature war mentaility failing.  Work flows and analytics more important for most customers. Most thinking within discipline.  Lot of baby products instead of integration.  Epic uses MUMPs and is integrated.  Regulatory issues now the focus, race to get to meaningful use.  Pain and customer attrition due to upgrades for meaningful use.

Accountable Care Organization (ACO) alliance between insurance and care.
ADP success tainted by McKesson failure in similar effort.

Cleanly verbalize handling technical debt moving to event horizon for failure unless movement for new features/meaningful use is tied to re-engineering and re-factorization into new enterprise architecture.

Cross check our pitch with their governance position helps prove they are on right track.

Created mm_test in access on PC{PI, but not loaded, since can't figure out how to link to mysql.
In PCPI, mysql -u root -p
	random1
created mm_test in PCPI, mysql,
did source testData.sql and generated testData in mysql on PCPI.
Need to find driver so I can load or link mysql tables to access.
Will create executable jar of freemind and install it in PCPI, then
	configure the database driver for Access to access after getting
	link tables to work.

Launched phpAdmin in T2_500G1(Snow Leopard) and did a full database backup to ~/Archives/localhost_111009.sql.zip.
Did backup of mm_test, mantis data, and sc_app databases also.
Going to test with Lion now to get mysql, netbeans, and eclipse all working.

Able to connect to cvs repository on my remote server using

cvs -d/Users/woo/cvsrep co -d :extssh:woo@jwooten37830.com:  sql

but command line brings it in with all the header crap in front.  From Eclipse Ganymede, it works fine by providing the repository information and checking out from it.

John Wooten's Time Capsule password is random1.  Must mount through network before trying to do a time capsule backup.


---20111119 15:00:45
Just tried it again.  I'll review it and see if I can make it output to
the yearly notes like Notes_2011.txt.

---20111122 12:30:44
Spent from 11:00 to 12:30 in conf call with ARK_ICU demo'ing freemind
and showing how to checkout, compare, commit, tag, show history, etc.
Demo went well and program worked flawlessly.
Need to think about sub-maps that are "groupings" of nodes that are tagged 
and can be reused elsewhere by name when inserting a new node OR group of nodes.
Next big item is importing maps with VA ids and doing a generate of
ids and changes for vendors.  ***DONE***


---20111122 18:10:01
Created automysqlbackup to do automatic backups on mysql databases.
It currently does mm_test, blog_db, and bugtracker every day and rotates
weekly etc.  It does a full backup of the entire database monthly.
the backups are done to /var/backup/db.  To see them right now,
do su/Fester. I changed the access to 755.  Check this.


---20111122 18:23:59
Added a /etc/daily.local with the line to /User/woo/bin/daily_tasks.sh
and in that I call the automysqlbackup pgm with its config file.  It logs
to daily.out, weekly.out, monthly.out I believe.  Not sure as the same program handles daily, weekly, and monthly.


---20111123 13:06:43
Changed the password on wooten.666@gmail.com to black.beauty
Created channel id of woo37830 on youtube.  It uses wooten.666@gmail.com and
its' password for access.

Had problem in that xanadu mysql root password didn't work.
Had to:

Stop the mysql daemon
mysqld_safe �skip-grant-tables
mysql �u root mysql
update user set password=new-password;
flushprivileges;
exit

restart daemon.
The mysql panel seemed to be able to start and stop the daemon
the /tmp/mysql.sock points to /var/mysql/mysql.sock

Why am I unable to use gestures on the lion server?  I can't find expose, etc.
Found out my mouse pad doesn't support full gestures on the Lion Server.  Older mac and all.  Did manage to find, with Diannes help, that setting left option as the Mission Control would cause it to show me what used to be called Expose and right command shows the "Applications?".

Cache.plist in it.  Move it to LaunchDaemons/backup.
Found that .rlogin.rc has some good things in it about calendar which appears
like it should show dates/times of appointments, etc.
Also it does a todo list, but it doesn't trim out the ones that are DONE.
Need to add that so I have a completed and an active.

Upgraded to WordPress 3.2.1 on xanadu.
Fixed Kerberos problem on woo_laptop using trick from 2011 notes.
Fixed bad script in geek_scripts/main.bash where it was looking
to remove $myscriptname.text and I had commented out $myscriptname.
Time machine backups are taking too long.  What is happening?
Need to do a clone today.

Fixed redaction problem in javascript redaction.  Needed node.firstChild.title="" instead of node.innerHTML.title="".


---20111213 22:47:35
Worked on sc_app.  Found some errors, fixed them.  Be sure to check into CVS.

---20111214 00:09:48
Worked with workspaces/btree/com/shoulderscorp/btree KWICmain and Kwic.
Run ant run to build jar file, then java -cp btree.... com.shoulderscorp.btree.KWICmain with DragDrop.txt in same dir.
Note that need to get rid of leading and trailing quites, etc. and also
group items using TreeMap so they come out sorted.

Relay Health - Infrastructure Operations

50 gig/day incremental change.  50/24 = 2 gig/hr avg. has to be exchanged for redundancy.  Mondo DB a fundamental part.  Encrypted data on SAN or Mondo DB and in transit.  Mentioned use of consultants in bringing up Ashville? redundant site.  Less than $2M for hardware, etc. to duplicate current site using their architecture which seems very good.  They have a build out flow chart giving all steps and validations.  Canada has used process to replicate data center.

Very flat inheritance structure.  Some very large classes, e.g. MessageManager with over 12,000 lines.  Large if, else if structures or case statements to handle multiple arguments instead of using perhaps the Prototype pattern.
Code grew out of Visual Basic and early ASP pages with no OO design.  Now facing need for refactorization.  Classes tend to be, by and large, data containers for moving data to and from screens to database tables and there is a logical extension of the physical database structure in the class structure.  Building up technical debt in these very flat large classes.  Coming from a MS background and working only in that is often an issue that might be improved by architects and lead developers becoming more educated in Software Patterns and in Object Oriented Design.  Not suggesting major refactoring, but instead and awareness of how to slightly change the direction as going forward.  This would help to reduce code volume by improving abstraction and increasing reuse.

Looks like good capture of performance data including errors, servers, message volumes, queue waits and lengths.

SPROCs in core of system 3549
496,444 SLOC include common comments, etc. of about 40 lines per SPROC
139 Avg rows per SPROC

About 800-1000 tables, that's a lot!

private static final char[] HEX_CHARS = "0123456789abcdef".toCharArray();

public static String asHex(byte[] buf)
{
    char[] chars = new char[2 * buf.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < buf.length; ++i)
    {
        chars[2 * i] = HEX_CHARS[(buf[i] & 0xF0) >>> 4];
        chars[2 * i + 1] = HEX_CHARS[buf[i] & 0x0F];
    }
    return new String(chars);
}

Downloaded and did build of lucene.  It provides stemming, and other text handling featrues that coulc be useful in redaction or in KWIC.  I placed it in Development/workspaces and intend for it to be an eclipse project.
One thing to look at in the current KWIC (and in the Test HTML highlighter is to be sure that I'm reading the data in like I do in StyledText.  This may be why the funny characters are in the text.

Installed mongo db and created alias in .alias to start the mongo daemon and also run the mongo shell.
Got php working on this computer and downloaded and installed the mongo driver for php and tested it with ~/mongo/sample_session.php.

---20111217 17:51:21
Created a VMWare copy of Windooze just in case I can't get Parallels license working.
Found that Deep6 de-selection of email in filter did not stop it being highlighted.

---20111219 16:48:20
Got DBD::DBI working.  Had to screw around with pointing to library
by adding it to .bash_profile about where to look.  
Now need to do the inserts.  Clean up the leading " etc.

---20111220 10:54:44
loadCRs loads changeRequests csv file into database on server.

---20111220 12:15:10
Created Deep6.app for Mike and published it to public.me.com/jwooten37830.
I added two hours to my time log for this.
Also, it was done using Eclipse, export as mac os x bundle.

---20111220 14:58:12
Got the export from Excel of the Terminology change_requests to work using
the tab delimited AND changing to separate the resulting one input line using 
\r.  Once I got the table structure, input, and spliting working, it was okay,
BUT, it was also necessary to remove non-printable characters using
the pattern I blogged today.

---20111220 15:55:05
Downloaded and installed JDepend plugin for Eclipse.  Important to click on the src folders, not the projects.
Also downloaded and installed the JDepend zip file and installed it into
~woo/lib and added the CLASSPATH and JDEPEND_HOME as stated in the
web page under ~/Documents/Reference/JDepend.html.  Tested and got it to work.
cd to Development/workspaces/btree/target and did
java jdepend.swingui.JDepend classes to see ui.
java jdepend.textui.JDepend -file report.txt classes to see text ui.
Also possible to get xml using xmlui.
There is an interesting FitNesse that gives a graph.  I'll have to try that.

---20111221 13:50:17
Downloaded statcvs.jar and placed it into ~/lib/jars along with html page.
The command java -jar ~/lib/jars/statcvs.jar logfile.log ../sc_workspace
creates a massive number of html files in the directory sc_workspace with
stats about cvs activity, etc.  It must be preceded by a cvs log > logfile.log
command.  Looks good for monitoring cvs usage and watching for problems in
combination with JDepend above.

---20111221 14:45:47
Created two bash scripts to run svnstat and cvsstat each with the name
of the project to be analyzed.  They check out the code into ~/tmp and either
redaction for svn or cvsstat for cvs.  They do the analysis and then
attempt to start firefox on the index page.  They won't work if firefox is running yet.

---20111226 20:50:25
map_terms.pl creates an xml file of the nodes to do a commit.
Create file, open it, do checkin.  cardio.mm is a short test.
Updated freemap so that it saved the additional columns. ( need to update sql and documentation )
Updated so that it could checkout and display all attributes ( fixed the dependency on 4 attributes at least in the checkout.  Check other places )
Need to add a way to create the genericIds when they are not there.  Possibly a separate menu item?  
Need to insert a table generic ID, verdor name, vendor display.  Have them filled in ( perhaps separately from generic load ).
Write a report to display the genericId, concatenated text, vendor stuff?

---20111228 11:59:13
Added vendorDisplay where genericId is mapped via vendorId to the vendor specific display.  vendor 0 means the alternate display.
Added the change_requests table with change requests.  Not clear how to use.
Will add a right click on node to show vendor display for that node (and revision history?)
Will add menu item to create generic ids if null?
Bring up list of CRs avail when ready to commit? via mag glass icon?


---20111228 17:09:21
Got reading of icon and color and cloud right.  Storing is still off
as it's storing java.awt.Color... and images/icons/idea.png... instead
of a #3Cffff and "idea".  Also is updating every node because compare is wrong because of above.

---20111229 18:42:38
Getting problem updating node nubmers from -99.x to new node.  Not
getting the next major when I should!  Reload and check.

---20111230 14:16:10
Adding genericIds, handling next major, etc. okay.
NOT detecting icon and bgcolor changes and persisting!  ***DONE***
