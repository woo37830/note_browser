Changed the default httpDir, etc. to point to glassfish in WSApplication.
Tested that it would run qFOIA, court, ECI without reloading KBs.
sucessfully highlighted using web-service.
Tried to install a file-uploader but no joy yet.

---20120104 13:48:33
Got the http://localhost/~woo/upload/index.php uploader to work.  It was
the file permission on the upload folder under Sites needed to be a+w.
Fixing the permissions on valums or fileUploader did not help those however.
The simplest however is just ~woo/upload_file.html which uses upload_file.php

---20120104 15:27:34
Fixed the timelogger so that it does 201201 instead of 20121
Found that to put html into word press had to surround by <pre><code> </code></pre> AND replace < by &lt; and > by &gt;  (create macro?)

---20120104 15:52:53
Got the image in upper left of index.html to stay fixed and not scroll by
using fixed.  Can't see how to move it anywhere else yet, however.

---20120105 12:40:06
Left nodes are being added and persisted.  Links to other maps or to other nodes within a map are working and being persisted.  Colors are persisted. Diff shows the removed properly (with orientation correct) and new and edited colors temporarily.

---20120105 15:38:16
Updated tex, ER.jpg, regenerated technical manual, checked in all code for freemind.

---20120110 12:36:03
Ran loadCRs on Terminology_view.txt to load cr's.

---20120110 12:57:05
Added update 0000-00-00 00:00:00 to Null into loadCrs at end.  Works.

---20120110 15:26:57
Checked in all except ChangeRequestPanel which is not started.


---20120111 17:16:40
Created ChangeRequestPanel, integrated it into History & CommitPanel.
Sent image out for review to Gerald, Smelling, etc.
Created draft User Manual, sent out for review.
Added access methods to ChangeRequest to find CRs containing values in colums.
Need to refactor DataBaseReader to move some things into named classes. TODO

---20120112 12:48:38
Added FindAction and FindPanel and implemented in MenuExtender.
Still need to add the scroll to visible for the found item, once found!

---20120112 18:26:05
Refactoring data base actions into classes such as ChangeRequest and TreeNode.
Will need to create a Map class with fields and behavior.  Refactor
its data base accessors into the Map class.
TEST AND TEST for infinite recursing in the retrieval of the nodes. DONE

---20120113 22:52:33
Did complete update of ports on SnowLeopard woo_laptop (i.e. Macintosh HD)
Did CCC from Macintosh HD to SnowLeopard partition
Checked that SnowLeopard would boot and work ( iPhoto seems to be missing )
Created USB of Lion installer
Downloaded Lion from app store and installed on Macintosh HD
Downloaded XCode from app store
Installed XCode 4.1 on Lion (Macintosh HD)
Checked that Mysql, php, Eclipse, Netbeans all worked.
Did an uninstall of all ports
started install of ports from myports.txt
DONE - check that daily, weekly, monthly all work

Procedure for fixing mktemp
 Did configure in mktemp directory and it created Makefile.
  Then did make install and it worked.
  HOWEVER, it apparently made a PowerPC version!  I deleted /usr/bin/mktemp
	and copied the created /usr/local/bin/mktemp to that location, but
	it was still a PowerPC version.  Need to find out how to turn off
	the PowerPC and make it Intel.
  Okay, checked that /usr/bin/mktemp was PowerPC version.
  found a newer config.guess at /Developer/usr/share/automake-1.10.
  copied it into mktemp replacing config.guess
  Then did configure followed by make install
  Then checked that /usr/local/bin/mktemp --v said it was correct!  It did.
  Copied /usr/local/bin/mktemp to /usr/bin/mktemp
  Tried mktemp --v and it said it was PowerPC!
  Closed terminal window and opened a new one ( rehash apparently isn't there)
  Now mktemp --v gives right version and runs.


---20120114 22:11:31
Finished all port installs.
Still have to do mktemp

---20120117 09:53:33
Added PromptForClient to show at wakeup.  Logs to system.log and to /Library/Logs/sleepwatcher/billing.log.
Also on sleep, script runs to turn off logging.
scripts are in .sleep and .wakeup  run by /etc/rc.sleep and /etc/rc.wakeup
note that the sleepwatcher daemon also runs.  Check that it restarts! DONE

---20120118 13:45:56
Updated PromptForClient to use only YES/NO buttons and cancel in client stops

---20120119 17:03:44
Fixed some unnecessary work being done when scanning and moved
the presentation of the results into the finally block so always there.
Added a LoginHook and LogoutHook through defaults write, but LoginHook, which
brings up the PromptForClient screen fails with an exit code of 2.
Found ScreenSaver 3 which will run applescript on screensave, etc. but
can't see how to run shell script from it.

---20120121 09:49:10
Changed password for jwooten@areteq.com to Fester1. on https://panel.dreamhost.com

---20120121 14:16:24
Created Database Tools document detailing the perl tools used to create and update tables.  map_terms.pl creates a map from a spreadsheet csv file, while etl_display.pl directly updates the vendor display table (and data dictionary) using information from the same spreadsheet about generic ids.

---20120122 12:53:28
Installed HomeBrew then did brew install play to install Play framework
Seems to be much like the ruby on rails in that it creates a framework for applications.
Seems to have build in hibernate and easy connection to mysql database for persistence
new installs seem to go to /user/local/Cellar and then are linked to proper places.

---20120122 15:56:33
Created vendor_display.pl with proper output using css into ~/Sites/Vendor.html.  DONE launch automatically

---20120122 20:00:14
Did CCC to Lion before starting updating with AppFresh

---20120123 12:20:11
I cd'd to NetbeansProjects and then did a play new yabe
which created a yabe directory.  cd'd into yabe and typed play run
which allowed me to go to browser at http://localhost:9000/ and see the default
I then experimented with changing Application.java removing the trailing ;
and refreshed to see the error message.  Changed it back.
Then edited the conf/application.conf and turned on the memory db for testing
now see the Connected to jdbc:h2:mem:play;MODE=MYSQL
then edited the views/Application/index.html removing the #{welcome} and
replacing it with <h1>A blog goes here</h1>.  Refresh and see that instead
of default.
Then cd'd to ~/NetbeansProjects/yabe directory
Then created file .cvsignore with lines tmp, modules, lib, test-result, and logs
Then did cvs import yabe INITIAL start
and got a screen to fill in the initial information about the project
followed by cvs importing the code.  checked on xanadu and found that
yabe had been created correctly without the extra files to ignore!

---20120123 16:51:47
Continued and created first blog screen, saved to cvs.
Remember to do cvs -n update to see what files to add after cd'ing to project
Then do cvs add path to file use -m "message" if desired
Then cd above project and do cvs -m "message" commit yabe (for instance)

---20120125 11:43:47
Just discovered that every mysql command line entry is in ~/.mysql_history!

---20120126 20:43:59
Did some refactoring in the ARK project to put actions in freemind.database.action and the panels that have been
refactored into freemind.database.action.panel.  Also added a new Maint menu item with a dummy MaintAction and a MaintPanel for now.  They will handle actions like delete a map, roll back to a date, add a user, etc.

---20120126 20:45:37
Added a check for ~/tmp/.pfc file in beginning of PromptForClient.  If there, exit.  Else, create that file with the
date-time in it.  The file is removed when timelogger -f is run when screen sleeps, etc. This prevents two requests for the client when awakening since that has both a login and a wake event.

---20120131 23:13:20
Downloaded cloc.pl and tested on redation, freemind, and sc_*/src, looks good

Have a Merge operation under which the differences show as a table with the
CR and CR description beside each node that is different and a check box.
The first view, the CR's won't be there.  Have option to print the table.
Chris then creates the CRs in Sharepoint, we do an extract and load the new
Crs into the database.  The second merge then shows the CR numbers and reasons.  The Apply button now shows up ( since there are CRs assigned ) and if clicked, the nodes that are selected get updated, the others don't.  The CR number becomes a list of CRs that have been applied for this "merge".

We may also add a CR to our internal database and then export the "new" ones that can then be loaded into Sharepoint?  This would be partially done by clicking on the blank CR in the above display and bringing up a CR form to fill in the data.  Then print out a list of new CRs in CSV so they can be imported into sharepoint.

Can I put a version on the generic id?  Also think about query builder based upon selecting nodes in mind map with boolean operators.

We have version 1.3 of IC.CV checked in.  We have a version 1.3p (for prime) as a mind map that has never been checked in.  How do I compare them?

Note that if I save a checked out map to disk, close down, then read it in and do a compare to current, it shows differences!  Why?


---20120214  10:27:57 AM

Forget Merge for now.  Have way to enter a new CR and use next CR number.
Have way to export new CRs as CSV.  Mark them after being exported?
Have generate report have radio buttons for export as CSV, HTML and also
have a checkbox group for vendors.  We get 1 combined CSV for analytics,
1 each html and cvs(if selected) for each vendor selected.
In csv, put up to last element in one cell and last element is next cell.
Put out the database version in each row?

2/14/2012

Checked in the code with maint screen working for recent activity.
TODO, need to begin to create csv, html, etc. files as per Chris.

Added the "lorem" paragraph ability using lip sum without the space.
Also added p perl to add header at top of perl, and turned on the keyboard
Also added the command space to bring up keyboard changing.

Converted MaintPanel and action to RecentActivityPanel and action.  Moved menu item to everyone since it just reads and inspects.

Refactored the table handling mechanism from HistoryPanel and RecentActivityPanel into ActionPanel so they would be handled the same way.
Made changes so that HistoryPanel would come up with current map being viewed as selection in the comboBox if map is in list (i.e. has been checked in) and so that if a particular map is being viewed and a comparison is asked for that the date of the current map would show as the default under dates so user would know where they were in the list.  TODO might should highlight the row in the history table also?

Checked everything in.  Need to update documentation, load full data using Bob's trick of global replace of ',' by '
', then csv,  then on input replace '
' with ',' to reduce error inputs.  After loading complete the generate reports so we get all the reports Chris asked for.  STILL NOT CLEAR about how to handle changes in labels since the generic Id still appears in nodes list as well as in vendorDisplay.  (remove this?  how to handle?)


---20120220 17:18:49
Loaded cardio.mm from 20111031_ICU_FINAL_V1.2.1.csv after extensive edits.
Removed all &, commas, and 's, from xsft file, saved as csv.
Used map_terms.pl to load into database.
Then cleared the vendorDisplay table as the etl_display.pl does not skip over existing entries yet.  Got it to load the vendor display table.
Did backup on xanadu called 120220_1720.sql of all tables.
Now going to run vendor_display.pl just to look at the vendorDisplay data.


---20120222 17:38:52
Received v1.3 from Chris which is Anesthesia.  Has more columns, slightly different in that root nodes are given.  Create a version of map_terms.pl that reads the Anethesia csv (which I edited, removed 's, ',' &, etc ) and creates an anesthesia.mm.  There are no vendor displays.  What do we do?

Chris will add new column to my spreadsheet with N(new), C(change), D(delete) and antoher with CR #.  I create a new commit for each unique CR # ( i.e. sort by CR # ).  Then be able to display map by CR # if not approved ( new column in links with approval date ).  Now show diff before CR # and with CR #.  Have new button "Approve/Dissapprove".  If Approve, then put approval date on diff rows and commit.  If Dissapprove, then commit, but don't put approval time.  now for a release show the map with approved changes (diff between previous version), or unapproved( diff between previous version(release) ).  Then create release with only approved links.

TODO - Add vendorId column (int) to link table.  default is 0 ( VA ).
TODO - Add approved boolean col to link table.  Only approved links will be released.

displays:

Show all nodes changed since last release that are approved.
Show all nodes changed since last release that are unapproved.
	(perhaps show a list of the "phrases" with approved/dissapproved boolean) - col with E,N,D. & CR#

Clicking on a row expands that row in map, hiding all others.

Modify the checkin logic so that approved is stored. and if edited ( including the approved switch ).  If editing under a vendorId, then changes are stored with that vendorsId.

Modify the generate logic so that only approved are pulled.  Afraid that the date that the approval is done needs to be there.  Absence means unapproved.

checkout logic gets vendorId = 0, then gets appropriate vendorId nodes and overwrites the vendorId = 0 where they have the same id:parentId.

3/6/2012

Change recent activity so that instead of mapId we show the map name.  DONE

3/6/2012

On the About this Map, put the name, number of nodes, branches, last action, (recent actions?), vendor id, vendor name, number of unapproved changes?, IN PROGRESS

3/6/2012

Don't allow duplicate genericId, when loading.  Show conflict and stop.

3/6/2012

Consider the problem of DoD not having 1-1 with VA branches ( genericIds ).  Look at 1-N and N-1 cases.

Big Picture

Developed SaaS application for  1-5 doctors (sweet spot).  Started with ASP product database and built new functionality to new stack.  Added clinical functions to the product.  Version 1 of product which came out in December of 2011.  Goal is to incrementally add functionality in an agile fashion.  Released one in Feb, another scaled for Map.  Planning in 90 day cycles.  Moving to smaller incremental drops.  Customers think schedule is too long based upon their desire for new or improved functionality.  Small number of customers right now.  Q1 is 301 providers, in Q2 add another 300.  5 provider practice has about 10 actual users, i.e. 1-1 provider with support.  Med Access being shut down end of this month.  ICD10, ANSI-10, other billing regulations.  Certified for Meaningful Use 1.  Connecting through Relay Health for other functionality.

Visit Doctor in FL.  Connect with regional centers through Relay Health, or give patient CCD document on thumb drive.  If other end has consumer of CCD, then can provide service.  Looking at more connectivity with Relay Health or other connectivity providers.

Have built in Health Language Institute( HLI) mapper to handle different terminology.  Does translation.  ICD9 is subset of ICD10.  HLI server does mapping.  Recognized deficiency or weakness in that not enough doctors and SME's working on the product as it is being developed.  Should have had dedicated SME to help with design of clinical part.  Worked from previous product.

Minimizing rework it is important to have more customer base through Advisory Board.  Had initial problems with converting from client-server over to thin client as they were sending too much data to the client.  Reeducation was done and now improved.

Probably would have chosen something different from Silverlight.  It was being pushed by MS and looked good.  Appears that Silverlight is being sunsetted.  Up until 6 months ago, perhaps migrating to HTML5.  MS says Silverlight has features and going to push new technology stack based on Windows 8.  MS says it will be supported for 10 years.  We will continue to invest so that it has longevity.  Eventually move away from Silverlight towards HTML5.  ZAML, which is used in silverlight, will be in Windows 8 stack, should make it easier to move to new stack.

Could have a problem if cancel a tag.  Seems to try to tag anyway.
When doing a simple change of adding an icon to the map, then the diff
	shows 49 changes ( for anesthesia.mm ), but don't see why.
	Could it be spaces?  What else?
When getting the unapproved in the about this map, and the review,
	Get the date of the present map, and the date of the previous release to this map and get those nodes that are active and are unapproved between the two dates.
Check that the review works the same way.

MK call with David Denton and Kevin.

As many technology platforms and architectural stacks as there are applications, i.e the things that are like 10^6 lines of code, etc.

ISO 14764 software maintenance model adaptive, perfective, corrective, preventive, Lientz and Swantz

Take number of products to form core and development of SOAP style components to create new enterprise product, win by attrition.  Not redo legacy, build new and encourage reuse through some incentive system, leaving older products in the dust.  Mentioned standard documentation.  Product strategy. Power builder is trying to do a technology uplift.  ½ of that system is maybe being lifted into a MS web technology.  Rest in PB core.  Paragon product.

Relay, MHS are central players.  MHS has 25 products, payer side billing.  CMS in it also.  Next circle out Paragon, Clinicals, start trying to integrate.  Mostly HL7 integration.  Gradually build SOAP when finer grained than HL7 can be identified.  Relay and MHS are looking into formalism for exposing and managing.

Product strategy along with Technical strategy.  Business is not set up to have a product strategy.  Have we created another business unit with responsibility for services, but how to incentivize, etc?

Large amount of regulatory pressure puts spotlight on cost of changes. 50-100 possible changes, but a lot around the health record thus Relay might encapsulate a lot of that.  In clinicals business unit, products require gui changes and model changes to come into alignment.  Pub/sub not really embraced.  Using triggers etc. instead.

Kevins data is the data to use on architectural diversity.

Brought Robert up to speed getting startup working, and his database
	setup working.
He downloaded Perl and will install and check on using.
He will purchase book on Perl and send receipt to Jim with expenses.
I need to get anesthesia working in csv to map so we can find error.
Then how to fix?  Do I remove the existing map and reload?
Permissions?  Do they affect csv?  Probably re-check out and should be okay.
Look at the csv generation and the approval writting.

Worked with Adam this morning and found some places to fix.  Got the spacing working better on outputting html from pdf file, but not great.
Found some places where things were depending upon being not headless, fixed those.  Now getting redacted page but it either ends after the first redacted word OR the redacted pieces are off to the left by one character.  In the PdfStreamDecoder, I believe we adjust -1 when headless.  Maybe that's not necessary anymore.
Worked on FreeMind creating a better Tree class.  It now captures the entire tree nodes, and holds them, then creates a set of branches where if there are multiple versions of a branch, the additional are in history variable in the branch. The getCurrentBranch will return the one that is current. (Check if null!).
One can get the unapproved branches, the current branches and their reasons.
Need to work on the reasons as I don't think they are right.
Not sure, but seem to be missing one deleted branch, i.e. deleted a terminal node from a branch.  This should show up as unapproved.  Ah ha! the deleted node was approved!  Perhaps mark it unapproved when deleting it?  It would then show up.  ***TODO***
A deleted node has an id with modified != null and no other id with modified = null.  It looks like a new node?  How to tell apart!
An edited node has an it with modified == null and another id with modified null
A new node has an id with modified = null and no other id with modified != null.

Copy Tree and MajorMinorOrderedMap to backup and then restore Freemind to last version.  Test.  Then revisit Tree, etc.  Difficulty in way Tree was done was that can't reverse assemble tree from all nodes as they were active at different times.  Have to do it at a single time.  SQL much better at locating nodes by date than in code unless data is cached several ways all with indices by created, modified, etc.  Consider this for caching strategy then perhaps a SQL like approach could be used.  Build cache, specifying which items will be keyed.
Be sure to update prod and other tables from woo to contain the
	new deleted column.
Wrote tests for getting deleted nodes.  Works for simple case
Wrote test for getting deletedBranch, expected 1, got 14!

We found that if we adjusted the pre and post white in PdfWord, that it
threw off the spacing for the redaction when headless, but did pretty good job of presenting html output.
If turned off the adjustment, then pdf looks pretty good, but of course, html sucks!
Robert suggested that we have another method to get the html data from.

In E_4254, we are getting LOTs of output from PdfModelWriter Debug trying to show <TJ,  positions, etc….  Why is this happening?  Is it the log itself that is slowing things up? Why is this being logged?  Why are we in PdfDocumentWriter at all?

map Folded on open
Get rid of attribute indicator?
Select CR first, then make change to appropriate map as another way to navigate.
Color code entire path when showing diffs in compare. (Might just expand branch, but highlight in gray unchanged, and in green/red/yellow actual changes)
Showing unapproved should not require a release tag. any unapproved and not rejected.  Only those that are unapproved and not rejected.
Think about and create another ability to view (per vendor) the same
	"end nodes" but with a shorter path.  E.g. takes 5 clicks to get
	to Elevated Temperature, right, leg, part, foot, toe, big.
	Desire for a given vendor is that they click
	"Temp Symptoms", "Elevated Temperature: right leg, big toe" and it
	is the same as if all the other things had been clicked.  I.e.
	In this view, the other codes are compressed or hidden and we see only
	the vendor tag and its end description.  How do we add these nodes and drag things into place so that the final result doesn't create new numbers and no new genericIds.    Perhaps new node:  Select vendor, select map, bring up map, now in this mode, add node, identify it as a grouping node, cut or copy other nodes to attach to it ( perhaps only dragging the final node) then allow editing of the phrase for this "short cut" from the nodes labels.  These are saved as "shortcuts", with mapId, vendorId, parent of shortcut, label of shortcut.

Modes are show/hide shortcuts (showing them hides normal, hiding them opposite).  Checkout map, select vendor, normal might be the same as VHA using VHA node labels.  show shortcuts would show those rows for that vendor/map, that have shortcut flag, and the children that point to those shortcuts.  So children
would be duplicated when there is a short cut with parent pointing instead to
the shortcut id.
	Be sure that when you use the tool to create these alternative tools, that NOTHING is left out of the new view.

The get Unapproved Concepts and the get Deleted branches aren't working right in that The list of nodes to be finding the branch for should include the deleted nodes as we have to create the branch even if it is deleted. Be sure we fetch the nodes that have been deleted but not accepted or rejected as the full set of nodes so that we can find the parents of the leaves.

	REVIEW THIS AND WORK OUT LOGIC AND TEST!!!

Right now, it gets the deleted leaf, but can't find the parent as it is deleted.

---20120515  11:08:50 AM

Talked about adding an ability to detect words used more than in normal conversation and IF also used in a context that is of interest, then we automatically add this as a synonym for something and alert people to this detection.  E.g., The word "candy" has a normal occurrence of of 10 per 100,000 words.  We prepare a file with all words like candy and their normal occurrence rate.  We have a threshold such that if a word like candy appears more than 3 times the normal occurrence rate in a document (or stream of documents between two points), we trigger an action that points out that X is exchanging information with Y that uses candy more than 3 times the normal occurrence rate.  If we know that X and Y are suspected terrorist entities, then we add candy to our "sensitive" words in the terrorist context and perhaps its synonyms.

If we were scanning text messages, we might start seeing lol or omg or lmao as words that had never been seen before.  We would identify them as new terms/slang/abbreviations, etc.  An analyst would decide if they were important.

The idea of comparing against normal occurrences, then if greater, noting the sending and receiving parties is new.  If we know the sending and receiving parties are persons of interest, then these words are added to our sensitive word list for observing other messages where the parties may not YET be persons of interest, but because of an increase or even the minor use o

If such words beyond the normal occurrence rate would be enough to draw interest to those parties.

In phone discussion yesterday, identified need to provide a new kind of node, perhaps a GroupNode.  It would have a standard icon applied and children can only be attached to it though paste operation from another map.  These maps or Views will be retained, but the nodes are NOT renumbered.  A new kind of map, called a View, will be established.  How to get old nodes to connect to these new group nodes.  Appears that we'll have to create a many-to-many relationship in a new table.  Might rename the present links to nodes, create new table of relations which would  have parentId, parentMapId, viewId, childId, childMapId?
All children are linked to parents through this relations table.

I have installed mantisbt-1.2.10 and then downloaded jpgraph-3.5.0b1 and installed it under mantisbt-1.2.10/library and added a link under library named jpgraph to point to jpgraph-3.5.0b1. I then downloaded dejavu-fonts and ttf-bitstream fonts and placed them both under /usr/share/fonts. Since that didn't work, I then created a link named truetype and placed that under fonts pointing to deja-vu folder.

That also didn't work, so I created a link to /usr/X11/share/fonts/TTF named truetype and replaced the earlier one.

I edited the config file for jpgraph to be sure it pointed to the /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ folder.

None of this works. I am NOT on a windooze machine, but a Mac OS X Lion machine.

Please in posts be a bit more specific. It's nice to be so in the know that you just say download dejavu fonts, but some of us could use the tiny bit of extra information about where to put the folder, what name SHOULD it have, what is the path to it in order that it will work with mantisbt, etc.

In perl-forth, I am working on using the search function instead of
the associative memory lookup.  This is because if you define
	load forth.dict ( so that FORGET is there )
	and then,
	: tst 1 . ;
	then,
	: tst2 2 . ;
	: tst 3 . ;
	tst will now print out a 3.
	IF you then do FORGET tst2, tst should revert to printing out a 1,
	but with the associative memory, tst still prints out the 3 and has
	a potential for a crash since that memory could be filled with something
	else.

	So, load forth.dict, then
	1 searching ( to change to use the dictionary search method )
	then redo the tests to see if it works.  If all looks good,
	then we'll comment out the associative way for searching.


---20120826  9:19:35 PM

Keep working until I can load forth.dict using 1 searching from beginning.
Problem seems to be that pairs is somehow different from others. Or the
	definitions that set them up are.
When a word is defined it's vocabulary should be somehow identified.  Append
	a last byte to the name with the index into the vocabulary?
Before worrying about vocabularies work on forget to get it right!

ARK

Need standards for import and export formats for CRs and Maps.  Put these
	into process.
Need rules for CRs, etc.  Like is a description required?  not in latest export.

What are the required fields, what are other rules about the items.


---20120828  2:08:08 PM

Need to provide a MODE where vendor navigation nodes can be inserted
	between existing nodes for grouping.
	This will mean that those nodes that get added change nothing as far
	as IDs, etc.  They exist for display.

	Root -> Nav-node1 -> Nav-node2 -> original node or branch

	We store without addeing or changing genericIds for the nav-nodes.
	On export we create max depth then put va nodes in level they are in,
	but nav nodes are in columns where nothing exists in VA node.

Present link parentId will now point
	to a row in the views table
	that row contains the mapId of the referring node
	and contains the modeId ( like picesView1 )
	the pointer to the parent
	and the mapId of the parent

	Draw this up and then create a test and some test sql.
	Create a map with these links, be able to retrieve the map, verify
	Create a view of the map with grouping nodes and retrieve the view.
	Show an update of the map ( using our update methodology ) and
		show new version of the map and new version of the view.
	Be sure to test for add new nodes, edit nodes, delete nodes, etc.

Appears that to create sin and cos into pforth I'd create functions in pfcustom.c and follow their instructions, then compile using PF_USER_CUSTOM
	and link with code, then rebuild forth using pforth -i system.fth
	supposedly would work.


---20120920  4:02:06 PM

Above, fsin, fcos, etc. are all in pforth.  Looking into gnuplot now.

a)  When new mac arrives, clone it to mountain lion drive first.

    e)  Install XCode
    f)  Set no lock.
    g)  test c code, utilities, etc.

Put note up on Blog about this!
Thinking about using Concept maps as a way to capture KB information and
	then use a thesaurus to get the equivs.  Go from the concept map
	to the xml for files, adding in stemmed thesaurus terms as equivs.
Thinking about changing login to enter userid, password, and project.
	Keep a table of clients, another of projects, and use projectID in
	table of users and in maps and dataDictionary.  Fix queries.
Login will show database as production or explicit.  If yes, connect and
	check authorization.  If no, bring up url, database, etc. panel.
Add reviewer role and also SystemAdmin role above Admin.  Admin is for the
	administrator of a project and is specified in client table?
How to fix it so that genericIds are not part of the normal projects,
	but are part of specific projects.  Do projects have classes that get
	loaded when the user logs in?

Get ~/Sites working as a web site on localhost ***TODO***


---20120927  11:12:02 AM

Edited /etc/apache2/users/woo.conf and changed 3rd line, I think
Did sudo apachectl start in terminal window and apache started on port 80
localhost/~woo now works but no PHP, etc.  Just a simple web server
Probably move the web stuff under MAMP htdocs as it says only
	perhaps as different hosthames and start testing for
	move to Mini1 server backup
Tried ssh jwooten37830.com /opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin/mysqldump -u woo -p'random1' mm_prod > ~/mm_prod.dump.  It didn't get error and got 4.6 mbytes!
Now to pipe it to local mysql

ssh jwooten37830.com /opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin/mysqldump -u woo -p'random1' mm_prod 
 mysql -u root -p'root' mm_prod

Works!  BUT, I have two instances of mySQL installed.  The one I'm talking to
above is the one on port 3306, while the one MAMP controls is on 33060, I think.
the phpAdmin is talking to the 33060 one!  However, this does mean that I can run a script to hourly, for instance, copy the tables from jwooten37830.com to mini_1 as a backup.  Then figure out how to have a script that will swap the names for dyndns so that users will get swapped to running server if other
goes down.

Also figure out how to send a message to uses that the database is down for
maintenance, or is going down.  If I keep connection information for users, this could be done?

Need to figure out how to turn off the one I copied over including the system preferences and only run MAMP Pro?

When user logs in with project name, it must be verified to be a valid
	project name and get it's id.  Also get its clientId if valid.
	Then SysAdmin might be different, but Admin creates projects for that
	client.  Each userId has a projectId.
	Check applied projectId from projectName against user info.

	b)  copy nyc into sc_workspace
	c)  copy pcpi into sc_workspace

Figure out how to deploy from projects to server!
Ignore jboss and jira until later.  Are there any tools from the jboss or jira that would be useful?  look at email for atlassian

Moved nyc, pcpi-bpm, and sc_app into tomcat 7.  nyc works with a missing object viewer…
pcpi-bpm has problems with import of java.util instead of a class.  perhaps java.util.*?  layout issues, etc.
sc_app shows initial "error" about root/password but seems to be mostly okay.  Look at the Active versus waiting queue entries
	and Mops still doesn't work.  Also need to fully get the workflow working!

Consider dropping jboss out of computer after reviewing emails.

Each action will be responsible for handling the notification and it will look at the loaded menu rules, fire them

The first action to be instantiated will load all menu rules which consist of the menuItem, the rule and the accessor

Installed and compiled 4th.  Moved 4th directory to ~woo/Development/Forth/4th.  It is an odd forth, limited to the menu operations.  You can only compile
	and then run.

Got replication working between barsoom and xanadu!

	edited /etc/my.cnf on both.
	On barsoom put

data > more /etc/my.cnf
[mysqld]
log-bin=mysql-bin
server-id=1
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1
sync_binlog=1

	On xanadu ( the slave ) put

data > more /etc/my.cnf
[mysqld]
server-id=2
expire_logs_days=5
# Slave details
report-host=xanadu.local

On master did

mysqldump -uroot -p --all-databases --master-data=2 > dbdump.db

This includes the position information into the dump.

Then did sftp woo@xanadu and entered password and did >put dbdump.db

Then did ssh woo@xanadu

mysql -uroot -p < dbdump.db

then

mysql -uroot -p

and did stop slave;
	reset slave;
	then, start slave;

	then tested adding a row to users in mm_test_woo on barsoom
	AND it immediately appeared on xanadu!

Check the log sizes and numbers soon ***TODO***

Finally got back to no password ssh to barsoom.

	sftp .ssh/id_rsa.pub to barsoom (jwooten37830.com)
	Then ssh to jwooten37830.com and enter password.
	Then sudo vim .ssh/allowed_hosts and appended the contents of rsa.pub
		to the end of the allowed_hosts.
	from laptop can now ssh without password AND
	the cvs and script now works using ext:jwooten37830.com:/Users/woo/cvsrep as the cvsPath.

Exclude mm_test_woo and mm_test_rwm from the synchronization?  ***TODO***

The below put a dated jpg file into the Pictures/ScreenShots folder!

defaults write com.apple.screencapture name ""
killall SystemUIServer

defaults write com.apple.screencapture location "/Users/woo/Pictures/ScreenShots"
killall SystemUIServer

defaults write com.apple.screencapture name ""
killall SystemUIServer

Added replicate-ignore-db = mm_test_woo and mm_test_rwm to xanadu /etc/my.cnf

While supposed to work, this doesn't appear to.  mm_test_rwm is still being
	updated.




I need to exclude some files from being logged in the binary log to avoid wasting my network bandwidth and time on replication of caching tables.
i know there is

[mysqld]
binlog-ignore-db=mm_test_rwm
