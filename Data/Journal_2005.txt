	1.  Change the Bug Edit to be Service  Bug and the person it is going to
		is initially the role bugReviewer.  Assigns to another role,
		bugFixer.  BugFixer then can addNotes, mark as fixed in release xxx
		unable to replicate, ..., and route back to  bugReviewer.
		bugReviewer can route back to originator for clarification, reporting,
		or mark fixed and notify originator then mark queueEntry completed.
		*** TODO *** Fix the workflow to show this.

	2.  Copied jsps from, sc_app to sc_tests/conf.
		*** TODO *** Backup all files.
	3.  Archive the cvs repository.
	4.  Continue to expand the hr performanceReview now that Traits works.
	5.  Move the factories setup into the wf container and test.
	6.  Document the new transformers, actions, etc.
	7.  Prepare a document describing the system architecture, etc.
	8.  from in tasklist does not show the creator of the bugs.  Why?
		*** FIXED *** table_owner was referring to field owner not createdBy.
	9.  Fix tests so that I can run without distroying everything.  Maybe
		initally create a backup of the database objects and queueDB
		then at the end?? delete the new and rename the old back?
	10.  *** TODO *** Continue Completion of Entity.  It doesn't handle
		relationships and objects.  TestAttribution fails for objects.
	11. Installed Avida into D:/ProgramFiles.  The QTGui allows one to start and breed
		new generations of organisims.  I am interested in seeing how to
		"herd" organisms to solve new problems.  The example would be to
		"breed" a solution to adding numbers or looking for patterns.

	1.  Archived all code, tested sc_app.  All tests ( less 10 ) passed, app appeared
		okay.
	2.  WorkFlowContainer now loads the archivers, etc.
		a.  Login doesn't take this completely into account yet.
		b.  How to have SimpleApplicationContainer load the rules
			for that application?  *** TODO ***
			Do we initialize a RuleProcessor? if it's there, then
			we check to see if we have rules for the app and try to load
			them?  Keep track that we tried and don't repeat.
		c.  In the RuleProcessor, we get the notification, enforce the rule,
			and throw and exception if if fails.
	3.  When george logs in, he should only see the HR and SelfService.
	4.  When ralph logs in, he should see SelfService.
	5.  When woo logs in, he should see HR, SystemAdmin, and SelfService.
		The getApplications is not filtering by role.
		*** FIXED *** getApplications is filtering by role
		getProcesses is not yet doing so.
		*** TODO *** several tests were depending upon not filtering.  FIX


---20050111

	1.  Add a WorkCenter for all employees that has SelfService.  Every user
		gets that added.  *** TODO *** ralph has no applications!
	2.  Rules can be added for each company/application.  How do we
		get the company/application information into the notification?
		Or does the processing somehow get the current environment, get the key
		and then fire the proper rules?  Need the same thing for the workflow.
		i.e. keyed by company, etc.
	3.  The wf editor applet needs to use a service to get its xml strings and to save
		 them on the server.  Create web-app that has services for that.
		 *** TODO ***
	4.  Go back and fix the getting rid of test data.  Be sure all refer to DBTest
		at least through inheritance, and that all have setUp and tearDown.
	5.  This working version may not load the archivers and rules etc. automatically
		*** TODO *** check this and add if possible.

	6.  Archived all pcpi data to CVS.
	7.  sc_messaging and sc_validator need attention.
	8.  Add the icons to the wf_editor so we can create States and Actions.
		a.  When we create a new application ..
		b.  When we create a new process in an application...
	9.  Could we make ClassMetrics work as an Eclipse Plugin?
	10.  Find out about jira again along with maven.  Perhaps decompile to see some
		ways they do things.

	1.  Had to copy en-us under Development\Projects\pcpi\webApplicattion to get tomcat 4.1.12 version to even partially work.
		jira goes to d:\data\pcpi\config
		    Templates=D:\jakarta\jakarta-tomcat-4.1.12\webapps\pcpi\
			Apparently we are getting html files from Development\Projects\pcpi
			still.  Even though the config says something else!!!
		tomcat copy appears to work also.  Check dates of files in both areas.
		Which has latest class files?
		Carefully run through demo *** TODO ***

---20050215

	1.  Look into atlast in tarfiles/src.  It is getting a compiler error in the structure
		at 3247 or so.  Maybe change so that it gets past this?  It appears to be a very nice
		callable FORTH-like language that can be used as a subroutine from another program.
		Might be very useful when certain things are needed.



---20050216

	1.  Installed ant 1.6.
	2.  Set ANT_HOME and MAVEN_HOME and attempted to use maven on sc_core.
	3.  Compiles etc. but cvs connection doesn't work.
	4.  Need to look at mule.  Put nyc aside.
	5.  sc_wfeditor now can add a state to the statemodel.
		a.  It now needs to be able to set the state name, and add the success and failure
			links to the model.  *** TODO ***
	6.  Rydex account - dewooten, DW0714
	7.  Added index.htm to wwwroot and to Tomcat root so that I have a hint about what is where.
		Tried to get it to show a rollover with passwords so I wouldn't forget.
	8.  Need to add jira and get it working again.
	9.  Start through HRWebpay and add the style sheets, etc.


---20050219

	1.  Need to add images to the index.htm so that I can see the alt's.
	2.  When saving a process, I need to be sure that if there is NOT an actionLibrary, to create
		a stub.
	3.  Also, write a brief script that builds the new jsp structure and puts a generic.jsp
		in if it was named(?).
	4.  See how to update the config file so that the Application contains the process.
	5.  Look at remove states, actions, and processes.
	6.  Presently in WorkFlowEditor working on creating a new application.  Need to add the
		application name and the application to the container.  *** TODO ***


---20050221

	1.  sc_wfeditor now correctly removes an activity, including links that go to or from it.
	2.  Still doesn't handle the removal of a link since it does not get the requestRemoval message.
	3.  Have to remove a process and an application, plus fix the saving of the application,
		process, and organization in the appropriate places.  We also have to include
		creating a stub actionLibrary.  Perhaps we need to provide a list in the config
		of available actions, that can appear in a "pop-up" to choose the action.  How to
		rename the inserted activity and links?  Further pop-ups?  Right mouse actions for rename,
		and delete?  How to update the information in the config file?  An editor?
		*** SOMEWHAT DONE.. SEE BELOW ***



---20050222 7:02 PM 


---20050223 7:58 PM 

	1.  Added showing available actions in combo box when transition is selected.  Name is
		change in transition if selection is changed.  Format of display for comboBox
		needs fixing.  *** TODO ***
	2.  StateMachine and ActionLibrary are saved into the applications/applicationName if it exists.
		Need to be sure that for a new Application, the application name is saved.
		Where does the organization come from?  *** TODO ***
	3.  Checked in all changes.



---20050224 12:38 PM 

	1.  Add a copy process to the process menu tab.  It puts the name etc. into a copy register.
		Then have a paste that highlights if a copy has been done.  It allows the process to
		replace the one in the window, except for the name.  OR, do copy and popup a window
		giving the application ( a selector, and a new name field ).  Like this better.

2/24/2005

	1.  Installed Python, and viewcvs.  Need to point the IIS virtual directory to the cgi scripts.
	2.  installed the viewcvs cgi's, etc.  They are in /usr/local/viewcvs-0.9.2.  The
		script that runs the standalone is standalone.py.  It is run with
		./standalone.py -g.  This will bring up a browser and show the directory
		of cvs.  It can't show files yet, as it isn't parsing the headers of the ,v files
		correctly.  It apparently thinks it is looking at an rcs repository instead of a cvs one.
	3.  rcs does not run since it has not been initialized.  Not sure about trying to have
		both cvs and rcs.


---20050226 9:04 AM 

	1.  Ideas on wf_editor.
		a.  Add to Edit a Copy Process..., Copy Application..., Delete Process..., Delete Application...
		b.  Need to add an icon for inserting a subProcess into a process.
			i.  It would bring up a selector of processes, and a new box also.
			ii. Not sure yet how to mark it as a process.  Look at the RoleBasedQueueingPolicy
				to see what is expected to do a push.
		c.  Check that Add Application works when a save is done.
		d.  How to edit the config file to include new information.
	2.  Think about using sc_app framework to build the ConstructionManagementPanel ( cmp ).
		a.  Should be able to create the different groups of activities ( applications )
			the processes within those ( processes ), and use the jsps that I already
			had.  In the jsps get the nav button data from the state models.  How to do
			the top nav.  Leave it hard-wired.
		b.  Should not have to create many elements beyond basic ones for user, etc.
			All data is handled by the jsps?  In this case the basic use is as a
			navigation framework.  BUT, it combines the use of workflow, so that when
			processes are added that require it, for instance, let's approve a policy,
			etc., it can be routed!
	3.  *** TODO ***
		a.  The structure of the jsp directory should exactly match the organizations directory.
		    *** DONE *** sc_app and sc_wfserver_http have been updated to reflect this.
		    BUT organization "Shoulders" has been wired in until getting organization is fixed.
		b.  All of this should reside in the conf directory in the webapps for sc_app.

2/26/2005

	1.  Added remove Application and Process with stubs to be implemented *** TODO ***
	2.  Added add New Process to a existing process as a subprocess.
		a.  Needs to complete the creation of the state model with initial activity.
		b.  If right clicked needs to open the sub-process showing it's model.  How
			to indicate.  *** TODO *** *** Fixed 2/28/2005 ***


---20050227 1:09 PM 

	1.  Added New Process as a StateModel into the existing StateModel.
	2.  When it saves, it writes it as a State, it needs to identify it as a StateModel! *** TODO ***  *** DONE ***
	3.  When the navigator comes to the StateModel, it needs to push.
	4.  The stateModel should automagically have a transition back to its parent called "Done" and one called "Cancel"
	5.  Need to add right click to descend into the new process.
	6.  Maybe better to create the process in a new window and then the process tool
		just brings up a selection to allow you to link it into the current process! *** TODO *** *** DONE ***



---20050228 8:15 AM 

	1.  Copy the editPrefs.jsp from nyc and associated files to sc_app. *** DONE ***
	2.  Create the table in access for users.  *** TODO ***
	3.  Create the table in access for preferences.  *** TODO ***
	4.  Use appropriate elements instead of the kludge in nyc, but fix editPrefs
		so that it works. *** TODO ***
	5.  Make all page backgrounds, styles, tableRows, etc. use the preferences. *** TODO ***
	6.  Add the edit prefs button to the top level ( perhaps as a hyperlink on the User: woo
		area.   *** DONE ***
	7.  Look at adding much of header.jsp and all of footer.jsp to our sc_app from nyc.   *** TODO ***
	8.  Need to revisit how sc_app uses style.jsp, etc. and see how to use the skinServer.   *** TODO ***

2/28/2005

	1.  Bugs in sc_app leaves the bug edit in the task list.  Not clear this is right.
		It also isn't saving the parameters about severity, etc. *** TODO ***
	2.  No way to finish a bug.  When it's routed to me, I need to be able to update
		and route it to the next person.  What are the rules for that?  How to mark
		it completed?  When I update and route to ralph, it doesn't dissappear from
		my (woo) queue.  Perhaps update isn't working?  *** TODO ***

2/28/2005
	1.  Hertz conf number with gold card - C8434341179


---20050305 3:01 PM 

	1.  Downloaded xui.  Placed into jakarta.  run runEd.bat to start editor.  Check this out *** TODO ***
	2.  Appears that Open in wfeditor doesn't bring up the process saved earlier.  *** TODO ***
	3.  Need to redo the parameter editor layout so that it looks better. *** TODO ***
	4.  Need to redo the setting of the initial Activity.  The state model knows it.  ... *** TODO ***
	5.  Need to have an overall description of the process available when the Process icon is dbl
		clicked.  *** TODO ***, link back to requirement?
	6.  Need to fix xml writer and reader so that <stateModel> can be embedded in a stateModel. *** DONE ***
	7.  Continue with MOPs.
	8.  See how this would work with a Policy that automatically created links to Processes, initially
		to the createProcess xyz, then later to the created processes.  Processes would have an
		attribute that back-linked them to the Policy.
		The policy would go through a review/approval cycle.
		The procedures would get routed throuh a similar review/approval cycle.  need
		the applet here.  Need a servlet that will supply the statemodel, etc. when
		the applet is started and sends a message?

3/5/2005

	1.  Got null pointer in ObjectInspector.actionPerformed (202) when tried to save the Transition
		after assigning the noop action to it. *** Fixed 3/6/2005 ***
	2.  Need to save layout preferences, etc. to users preferences at some point and use them.  *** TODO ***


---20050306 12:21 PM 

	1.  Made change in ObjectInspector to create new NoOpAction if there was no action already there.
	2.  Noticed that I don't have a load function anymore.  Need to find it in container and
		cause the load of a saved file.  *** DONE ***
	3.  When saving file, the action Library is getting named xxx.xmlActionLibrary.xml!
		*** TODO *** *** Fixed 3/7/2005 ***


---20050307 7:33 AM 

	1.  The reading of the stateModel and ActionLibrary from a saved file, a la Test.xml on the desktop
		is fixed.  Need to check for reading from organizations, etc.
	2.  The ActionLibrary when being saved does NOT have the impl tag getting filled in.
		*** TODO ***.  This kills reading the action library.
		*** TODO ***   The impl must show up in the inspector for the action!
	3.  Do a through check of application.  *** TODO ***
		a.  Can I create a new Application?
		b.  New process within Application?
		c.  New Organization?
		d.  Add state to process?
		e.  Add Transition to process?
		f.  Add existing process as subprocess?
		g.  save edited or new process/application?
		h.  Read the process back in?
		i.  Update the config so that application/process is available through config?
		j.  Read in the config with new Organization/Application/process?
		k.  Execute the resulting process, etc.?
		l.  Monitor the process?  Use queueMonitor?
		m.  Model the process?
		n.  Elements?  How to add, specify for the state?  Autolayout.
		o.  Rules?  Add a rule to a transition to fire.
		p.  Notifications on state changes, etc.
		q.  Complex transitions?  i.e. aggregate ones.  How to edit.
		r.  Create model application with two processes, one to create a Policy specifying 2 processes.
			Approve that policy.  Cause 2 processes to get spawned to create process 1 and process 2.
			Route those processes through an approval cycle.
			Execute those processes.
			Show that retrieving the policy and clicking on the process, shows the process
				diagram.
			Show that in the diagram, the link back to the policy exists ( maybe more than 1! ).
			I.e. Why does this process exist?  Point back to policy or requirement.
		s.  As you create a policy or requirement, you specify the processes required to implement
			that policy or requirement.  That causes the enqueueing of the create process
			for those processes.  After approval, they are available for execution, but always
			point back to their requirement, AND the requirements always point to their
			processes.


---20050308 11:26 AM 

	1.  Split actual file access out into one or more services so that I can package wf_editor
		as an applet that knows the http address of the server through which it can
		send requests for files, configurations, saving, etc.  Think about interface.
		a.  getConfig(config directory, config filename)
		b.  saveConfig(config directory, config filename)
		c.  loadStateModel(organization, applicationName, businessProcessName)
		d.  saveStateModel(...)
		e.  loadApplication(organization, applicationName)
		f.  saveApplication(orgainization, application)
	2.  Create test applet that tests these requests.


3/8/2005

	1.  Created new XMLConfigurationWriter and XMLFileParser that
		can output an XML representation of the config file
		and read it back in.  Tested and it worked.
		This will be used in the applet version.  I can send a command to
		getConfigurationXMLStream given a directory and a file name
		and have it return an XML String of config data.
		Then create a config and tell it to parse the xmlString.  I should get the
		valid configuration to use.
	2.  The stateModel and actionLibraries are stored as XML, so should be able to read
		and hand off to the applet via a servlet or service.


---20050309 5:22 PM 

	1.  Updated the Header.jsp to handle the update correctly in nyc.
	2.  Updated the editParm.jsp to show selectors in comboBox.

			and exchange between vendors and program management.
		g.  The information system will meet all necessary and relevant security requirements.
		h.  The management information system will meet the needs of all RAD programs with the
			functionality they require without forcing undo complexity due to the needs of
			another program.
		i.
	3.  Identify or obtain the services of a team that will translate the vision into
		an IT Strategic Plan, an information system requirements document, and an architecture for OCRWM.
	4.  Create an "staged" RFP for software and hardware that is aligned with the IT Strategic Plan
	5.  Steps to create an 5 year IT Strategic Plan
		a.  Identify HQ reporting and management systems for which information input
			is required.  Identify the data fields, formats, and times for each
			system.
		b.  Identify NRC, DOT, and other regulatory agencies information and reporting
			requirements.  Identify the data fields, formats, and times for each
			system.
		c.  Identify "best-of-breed" sources for multiprogram operations that have
			construction, regulatory, litiginous, and operational issues across disparate
			but connected organization.  E.g.  Excelon, AECL, Adams Aircraft?
		d.  Identify sources for template policies and procedures for each operating unit.
		e.  Use total system model in association with time-line for the total system
			to create the IT acquisition and development time-line.
		f.  Acquire requirements capture and policy development and approval tool early.
			As requirements are identified, they are captured and the requirements approval
			process is used to validate.  All other actions are "tied" to specific
			requirements and/or policies.

		Creates packages added, removed, classes added, removed.
		Creates counts of those that are there, those that compile, those that
			have content ( i.e. more than simple get/set )
			and those that have documentation ( i.e. more than x%),
			and those that have test cases in sc_tests.  (later those that
				pass those tests by looking at a log of regression test results).

1.  Download HolubSQL.jar, version 1.0a, released 27 Sept, 2004.

If you have Java installed on your machine, you can "open" the file rather than saving it to the disk if all you want to do is run the console application.

HolubSQL.jar is an embedded SQL interpreter (with a JDBC wrapper), as described in my book Holub on Patterns. By "embedded," I mean that this is a set of classes that you incorporate into your program. There's no separate server, and all of the database tables are held in memory (until you flush them to disk explicitly). The database is quite suitable for small applications.

The .jar contains an executable version of a small "console" application that exercises the database, the .class files that comprise the database engine and JDBC layers, the source code presented in the book (with known bugs fixed), and javadoc documentation.

Execute the downloaded program with java -jar HolubSQL.jar. A popup will prompt you for the full path name of a directory to use as your database (tables are files in the directory), and then the console window will display itself. Type SQL into the top window and see the results in the bottom one.

You don't have to unpack the jar unless you want to look at the sources or documentation. You'll first be prompted for a directory to use as the database (tables are files within that directory). This directory must already exist when you launch the console. The console itself will then pop up. You can type SQL into the upper window, hit "Submit," and see the results in the lower window.

For the jdbc layer (and console application) to work, you must install the J2EE JDK to get the java.sql.* interfaces. You do not need to download or install Sun's application server, which is part of the all-in-one bundle.

To use the database classes in your own programs, just put the .jar file into your CLASSPATH environment. (After doing so, you can execute the console with java com.holub.database.jdbc.Console if you like.)

 I've tested using both Java 1.4.2 and the Java 5 release candidate, the enclosed .class files are 1.4 files, so should run fine with either JVM. Note that the code will generate a few "deprecation" and "uses unchecked or unsafe operations" warnings with the 1.5 compiler. There is no way to eliminate these warnings and keep the code 1.4 compatible, so you may want to compile with the -nowarn or -source 1.4 flag.

2.  Downloaded various other Holub jars and zips to look at.  Added Holub index and pages to favorites.

	1.  When ralph logs in, the Self Service Application shows up in the dropdown, BUT
		a.  The application in the header is HR
		b.  The list of processes is from HR, not Self Service. *** TODO ***
		c.  This list should come from the available applications not always the default.
	2.  Change sc_app to use sc_app database copied from metrics.  drop classes, etc. stuff.
		just users, persons, preferences.

3/23/2005

	1.  Create a graph of quadrants of silo, layered, distributed showing x versus y.
		Complexity, cost, schedule, etc.


3/23/2005

	1.  Possibility that the entry for the process ( bp ) is being overwritten by the initialState
		with the same name?  Where is the description for the stateMachine going?
		*** DONE ***

3/23/2005

	1.  StateModel now reads and writes out its description.  However, the editor cannot read back
		a model from the desktop.  Probably something with how it constructs the path
		from the name. *** DONE ***


---20050324 12:31 PM 

	1.  Downloaded the MonteCarlo.xls to use in Excel.   Try it.
	2.  Prepare an email for Bob Wells re our visit to Excelon.  Discuss enterprise approach, and
		ask for questions that we might raise with them.  Send to Tom B. for review.
		*** CANCELLED ***




---20050326 12:02 PM 

	1.  Seem to have save and open working now for a process.  It required cloning the statemodel,
		and creating new navigators, and statemachines, as well as remembering to set the
		container in the navigator.
	2.  Now, need to build a better display of the object inspector so that I can show the
		implementation class when it exists.
	3.  The xml writer for the action library needs to handle the aggregate action and
		data actions as well.  Aggregate will have to descend recursively building up
		the constituents?  *** TODO ***
	4.  How to display the fields used on the screen and set them into the elements.  *** TODO ***
	5.  How to save an application that has had a process added?  Should I put a copy
		in for a process that is saveAs?
	6.  How to update the conf file so that app and process data is saved.  Doesn't that mean
		creating a series of ways to set company, users, roles, applications, etc?
		i.e. build an application editor?  *** TODO ***
		REMEMBER--- Goal is to create application, add processes, then screens with
		descriptions, buttons, fields/tables?, and run the application within a few
		minutes.  Step 1 is to add application, add a process with descriptions, and
		save the application, then update the conf file to reflect that.  Then run.
	7.  Why is HR:Test still dirty after I save it?  *** TODO ***


---20050404 10:10 PM 

`	1.  job_handleBy is not a valid element.  Apparently not specified anywhere.
	2.  bug remove not working.
	3.  cvs not working!!!!

	1.  Prepared rough draft of article on SolarBinary.  Sent to Rachel and Greg to review.
		Will forward to Physics Today for publication?
		Location:  ~woo/TeX/SolarBinary.tex



---20050406 10:04 AM 

	1.  Created businessobjects.mbd in data/sc_app/databases.
		a.  It contains in the users, the company attribute with table:BusinessUnit[name]
			and should contain for person, table:People[name]
		b.  When displaying, check if an attribute appears for that name and if table:
			is there, then go to the named table and use the value of the attribute
			to get the row by oid.  Use the [xxx] part to fetch that column
			and place in the field.  selecting, then get all and use that column
			as the selector.
		c.  Tested with sc_app and it shows the preferences okay.  Need to finish
			display of person and business unit using the above.
		d.  Change the login to use the users in the table and update their last login, etc.


4/6/2005

	1.  Create quadrant showing effect of stove piping on cost/complexity.
	2.  Create lists of software in stages.
	3.  Show time table of business, with it aligned.

4/6/2005

	1.  Configuration loadXML(File x) is not completed.  It needs to open a stream buffer
		and read in the file then pass to the xml parser.
	2.  Copied the xmlReader and xmlWriter from the Configuation util.  Need to make it
		read and write the config file.  Actually, this isn't needed since the config file
		is already readable and writable. (See 1 above).  Test writing out sc_config
		again.
	3.  Remember to copy (from where) the process folder, rename it, and be sure it contains
		the generic.jsp.
	4.  Fill in the generic.jsp by default when creating an activity. (Should we get a list of
		files in the process directory to select from and have a create function?  It really
		just copies the generic.jsp and renames it?)
	5.  Do the test of the stacked app to see that we can create the stacked entry and
		restart from it, then on end, we unstack correctly.  *** TODO ***
	6.  Test adding the new app and processes to the config. *** TODO ***
	7.  Try creating a panel to set some of the relationships between app and process and company. *** TODO ***
	8.  When click on process, bring up more data about workcenter, company, etc.
	9.  Create a new workcenter? new role? new business unit?


4/6/2005

	1.  When I save a new process, I should save the xlate-doc.html for that process along with the xlate-format-html.xsl
	that it uses.

4/6/2005

	1.  SaveAs failed in WF_editor.  Also did not appear to write out the description.


---20050407 4:33 PM 

	1. Corrected SaveAs, and created SimpleTest with Stacked Process.
	2. Stacks and moves into stacked Process fine.
	3. Working on popping.  recovering navigator, and going to the proper next state.
	4. Appears might have to add a new queueEntry with the name StackedProcess, State?
		so that transition can be made from it?


---20050408 7:28 AM 

	1.  When reading in an imbedded StateModel( or any statemodel ), it doesn't read in
		the transitions on the statemodel itself.  *** DONE ***
	2.  When reading in the Stacked queueEntries, be sure to check that we only get
		the one with the proper JobID. *** DONE ***

4/8/2005

	1.  Fixed so that embedded state models are properly navigated when using RoleBased Queueing Policy.
	2.  Need to check that the documentation xsl works with embedded state models. *** TODO ***


---20050411 4:36 PM 

	1.  Successful test of navigating stacked state with automatic handling of the "next" transition.
	2.  Probably need to modify editor so that it adds the "next" transition when
		the process is added to the current process.  Limit bpFigure to having ONLY one
		outcome, i.e. "next".
	3.  Need to move jars to sc_app and test.  Probably need to add generic.jsp to steps
		in Simple, etc.
	4.  Test with a edit/add person set of screens as a process that can be nested.



---20050412 5:29 PM 

	1.  Downloaded spring-workflow and new maven and tested.  Some configuration problem.
	2.  Still configuration problem with eclipse and cvs.
	3.  Need to clean up logging on the workflow to show clearly the steps, etc.
	4.  Need to add data to the generic screen.  Show the fields listed as data? under data-elements?
		perhaps add a (r/w) flag to the elements?  Affects parser.
	5.  Test with sc_app!!!!! *** TODO ***



4/12/2005

	1.  Seems we should move
		<%

			Map properties = container.getCurrentState(env).getProperties();
			Iterator transitions = container.getCurrentState(env).getEventNames();
			String title = (String)properties.get("title");
			String description = (String)properties.get("description");
			String data = (String)properties.get("data");

		%>
		into header.jsp so all would have and remove it from all other pages.
		and create a new page at same level as header.jsp called data.jsp
		that would contain.
	    <%
	    	if( data != null && data.length() > 0 )	{
	    		%><center><h3>Data</h3><table><tr><th>Field</th><th>Value</th></tr><%
	    		StringTokenizer tokens = new StringTokenizer(data,",");
	    		while( tokens.hasMoreTokens() )	{
	    			String key = (String)tokens.nextToken();
	    			String value = "tbd.";
	    			%>
	    			<tr><td><%=key%>:&nbsp;</td><td><input type="text" name="<%=key%>" value=<%=value%>></td></tr>
	    			<%
	    		}
	    		%></table></center><%
	    	}
	    %>
	This would be included inside the form part of the generic.jsps and anywhere else
	one wanted default insertion of the data fields.  Also look at getting the value
	and if string setting it, if boolean set it as radio, if object, set it as
	trimmed objectName:oid.  What about selector?

	*** TODO *** Do this, test, fix all generic pages, etc.  Now, how to fix it
		so that the data elements are also retrieved and displayed automatically?

	2.  mops.xml needs to be added to the elements and linked in.  It needs to include
		the elements required by a mop and added to ScheduleReview.xml to be displayed
		on the generic page for the add mop to test.
	3.  Weights for Traits are set globally for all employees when the traits are created.
		The creation of traits is a separate process.
	4.  Seems like the traits displayed should always be the current set of company traits?
		or should it be what they were when the review was scheduled?

	1)  For 11-14,

		a)  xfer $1200 from savings to share draft - *** DONE ***

		b)  check Dew account - *** DONE ***

		c)  check bills paid/left to pay. - *** DONE ***

		d)  pay any due this week. - *** DONE ***

		e)  Call Tonya from Bay Pines. - *** LEFT MESSAGE ***

		f)  Check with Sylvia at ORNL about account training.


		1a)  DI ( i.e. FileMan ) has 27579 lines of code.  A lot of it is a mail handling system.
		Much more is screen messages, prompts, error messages, etc.
		.84,181001,1,4,0 etc. contain JavaLink exception messages.
		.84,7980000.015,3,"B" seems to relate to AIDS data and controlling access to it.

			Why does a "File Manager" contain application specific behavior?
		.84,7981007.001,2,8,0 seems to contain lots of xslt style sheets!
		DIA.zwr contains 1,266,712 lines of code basically with Drug information.

		In namespaces I see VM, with work at Univ of Tenn.  Why don't I see that in the
		*.zwr?
		Where is this code?   How large are these codes that aren't here?
		VR is another example.




	2)  For Visit in San Antonio - Ted Mueller - SWRI - San Antonio TX
			Bob Parker, VISN 16-17 in San Antonio, pgm mgr overseeing business process.  COTAR for project.

		a)  Brief statement of project - User Interface App for RSA as J2EE along with
			mid-tier and database to support.  Presentation, mid, and persistent
			layer.  Interfacing to legacy (mumps) to feed other apps in VA.  Data
			API will be exposed, not wrapped as SOA.  Is think client.  Can't inter
			face into HeV yet because of schedule and maturity.

		b)  How many developers? - 15, 2 mgrs( 1 dev, 1 deploy/test/train ), 15 QA/test

		c)  All in this building?  No, majority  Where? 1/3 in another bldg. 1 in Virginia

		d)  What is architecture? multi-tier, thick client, web-logic mid via JDBC, oracle db.
			 How decided?  Came down from VA as future direction.  David Vickers is SWRI architect.  OO Design done by SWRI, started with baseline doc.  Frustrating in that VA keeps
changing.  Started with .NET then to J2EE.  Used Rational Rose, iterative process for dev.  VA saw it as incremental rather than iterative, i.e. each cycle would have functionality...

		e)  Are there any work-flow aspects to the application? - tried to make flexible,
			via user prefs, etc.   Making appointment, leads step to step, but handles recurring separately.  Appointment purpose was added.  What is to be accomplished in an appointment.

		f)  How is this handled? Internal coding.

		g)  How will these work-flow aspects be exposed or used by other applications? Only through DB access.

		h)  How many pkgs, classes, external interfaces, database tables, screens, SLOC?
			Donna Tripp - will provide.

		i)  Describe the code repository and revision management system you are using.
			ClearCase,

		j)  Describe how QA is handled? Build move to test lab, smoke test automated.  Test team tells testers about broken code?  Test old broken to see if fixed.  Bay Pines wants distributed ClearCase, SWRI sees this as a problem.  What problem resolution system do you use? ClearQuest for issues and defects but only internally.  4 people on VA team re Bob Parker, test weekly on latest code and report out to Bay Pines where defects are mapped against their version.
How to improve:  Integration is big problem, i.e messaging and delivery, security, logging.  How to do more continuous testing but not point fingers.  VPN over T1 line is helping.  Must be cleared at each facility not nationwide. *** THIS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED ***  *** NEED CENTRAL TEST SYSTEM FOR VENDORS TO WORK AGAINST ***

		k)  What are the defect levels?

		l)  What is the current internal status for those bug levels?

		m)  Do you track rates of closure, opening, reopens? yes, yes, yes.

		n)  Describe your build process.  Build out of ClearCase 2x per week.
			Is it automated? For most part.

		o)  How do you prevent fragile code? i.e. god classes, interconnected packages, etc.
			peer reviews, other team reviews.  Architect sits in.

		p)  Do you have metrics on rates of production?  No

		q)  Do you have metrics on SLOC, classes, tested, etc?

		r)  What is the duration of this phase of the project? dev - COTs analysis showed 4x cost to do COTs, RFP out and SWRI won and started in 2001, 4 years.  Difficulties doing interface work.  Sets stage for others.

		s)  What percentage of the time remains?  15%

		t)  What percentage of the work remains?  ~30%, i.e. training, QA, changes, scope creep.  Move to Eclipse/Hibernate.  DB built as transactional, but reporting bigger endeavor.  Each VISN may have data warehouse?  Is this VA view.  VA had concept of enterprise DB, but may be moving towards distributed?

		u)  What are your acceptance criteria? - Acceptance plan has been created, Russ Holt works with.  4 mo. testing, using SWRI test base.  other tests done by Bay Pines in Jan.  Dec 29 functionality alpha.  beta starts Dec 2006.  General release + 6 mo.

		Resources at Bay Pines don't allow enough skilled people to move into other actions like QA.  Integration was held up because of a cruise by the integrator.

		Group appts was pushed out.


	3)  For visit to Salt Lake City,


		a)  Get Cameron to get Vista working on PC and Mac.

			i)  How is the 1.9 million determined out of the 15 million?

		b)  What is OCX and what are it's conversion plans?

		c)  OCXS seems to be a set of conversion routines and rules?

	1)  Received CD from Cameron.  Unzipped and counted txt lines.
		8,522,390 lines in 108 *.TXT files.
		Why 8 versus 15 million?
		Is this all, etc.?
		Sent note to Cameron to explain and try to get build script.
