---20010306
	1)  Added Changing Look and Feel.  Need to select Windows by default.
	2)  Found some events I can override on frame closings, etc.

		handle saves differently.
	4)  Add putting parent and child oids into GDO in ActivityDependency
		*** Fixed, but done in BusinessProcessFigure and LinkFigure ***
	5)  Add putting coordinates into GDOs when save is clicked. Do by
		overriding the read and write methods in Figures?
		*** Done ***
	6)  Need to keep track of the current business process oid as a
		"group id" in the GDOs.  If the group id is the same as
		the object id, then this is the diagram "head".
		*** Done ***
	7)  First step in a new diagram is to ask for a name.
		*** Done ***
	8)  Create the diagram head ( business process in this case ).
		*** Done ***
	9)  Store the name as the frame name.

	1)  Reading in objects and reconstructing figures.
	2)  StartProcess figure is displaying process name rather than "Start"
		*** Fixed ***
	3)  Positions being read in and out, but not positioning figures.
	4)  Need to add links into GDOs and recover them when reading in.
		*** Link info being read in and out, but figures not being relinked.
		*** Fixed 01-03-11 *** needed to set start and end position also.
	5)  Delete removes figures but not gdo's.
		*** Fixed 01-03-12 ***


---20010311
	1)  Fixed so that links being redrawn when gdo's are present.
	    need to fix so that bp will create new gdo's if not present.
	2)  Null pointer appearing in mouseUp of creationTool because the figure
		has not been created yet when the mouse up is detected.
		That is also why the toolDone isn't being called as a null pointer
		causes this to be screwed up.  Need to look at how to create figure completely THEN catch the toolDone() figure out what was created and set its parameters?
		*** Fixed 01-03-12 *** added mouseUp override. need to add mouseDrag also
	3)  Did backup to HD of all files
	4)  Need to check in the fixes and notify Jason, et. al.
		*** Done ***


---20010312
	1)  Got rid of first empty window.
	2)  Couldn't get initial look and feel to work without exception.
	3)  Got positioning working right. Had to movethem.
	4)  Getting exception during read... Don't know why yet. No problem though.
	5)  When gdos are being saved, get event.  Set link parents and children for bo's then in delegate. and save.
	6)  Redid menus so that only what we need are there.


---20010314
	1)  Updating parent or child of gdo causes update of underlying object.
	2)  When deleting link, must delete the underlying navigation link.
		*** Fixed 01-03-14 ***



---20010315
	1)  Put html templates for PCPI from Tim into p:\templates
		*** did so, these are the editable templates ***
	2)  Get new html/xml for en-us and put into inetpub under directories for pcpi.
		*** put artists rendition into inetpub/pcpi/pcpi-screen-templates
		Need to get these locations straightened out.
		Also, note that en_us isn't right, should be en-us.
		Copied files into both places now.
		Also those files aren't under html, but directly under en_us.
		Should be under html.
	3)  Remember to use shift key when opening and then edit constants in table.
	4)  Change reference to frontpage to point to my front page location in the edit button of the screen.
		*** Fixed 01-03-15 ***
		Consistent ability to preview, get prototype, and edit.

	5)  Refactored WorkFlowDelegate to get rid of some ifs
	6)  Arranged so that diagram is rebuilt from bos and uses existing gdos
		or recreates them.
	7)  Need to precreate a work flow and then see if it is built linked.


---20010317
	1)  Generate 10 new tables Table0-9 and 10 Objects Object0-9 and map them.
	2)  Have the objects be accessible.
	3)  Create a panel that allows me to add an attribute name to an object
	4)  Fix AttributePanel so that it allows setting and editing of those
		attributes.
	5)  Create a Panel for editing XML templates.  Have a button
		that says "Add Language".
	6)  Each field in the XML has as many rows as languages have been
		defined for that template.( look in directories for which ones).
	7)  Each row has language in front.  e.g. en-us "Duhh", fr-ca "Le Duhh"
	8)  When saved, give template name and a version gets saved to each language.
	9)  Check with Ron.  Can XML work without an HTML?  Can we generate
		a dummy that allows us to put fieldName, value...
	10) Demo scenario:
		a)  Come up with a process of 3 or four steps.
		b)  Name the process and lay it out with actions.
		c)  Edit first activity, assign a class ( Object0 ).
		d)  add attributes to Object0(name, birthdate, arrival date,...)
		e)  Edit route table to assign routeNames to attributes
		f)  Edit xml template and add fields in english and select routeNames
		g)  add language "fr-ca" and edit in labels and hints in french.
		h)  save template and enter template name into first activity
		i)  repeat for other actions ( we'll make Object1-9 routable
			to from Object 0?)
		j)  run pilot select process and enter data.  It should get saved, etc.
		k)  Should we have a rule or policy that we can specify on an action?  i.e. autosave? autosave with verify?
		l)  Edit the flow of the process and rerun.
		m)  Have one screen a list screen that links in ( how? ).
		n)  Later have one of Objects be a child of another and use
			as dependents.  How?
	 11)  When selecting PilotDelegate, don't use links, just get all Sites
	 12)  Don't allow selecting process, there aren't any.  Start with
	 	display of all Sites and edit from there.
	 13)  In getting gdo's etc., don't expose links.  See if can be done with
	 	addChild, etc.  That way "how" things are linked isn't important.


---20010323
	1)  Got PilotDelegate working and reading corebos.
	2)  Generated the tables, saving positions.
	3)  NOTE:  Use same instance of style again and again.
	4)  Check on creating new links instead of using ones there.
	5)  On readin, not recovering the positions and using them.
	*** Fixed 01-03-28 see below ***


---20010327
	1)  If edit "List People" and cancel, then caption of List People becomes "NULL".  Symptom of a problem with toString or such.
	*** Fixed 01-03-28 *** Problem where textField was indexed wrong.
	2)  Showing that parent is home and child is List for List People
	*** Fixed 01-03-28 *** Updates fixed by extend Core.


---20010328
	1)  Changed to extend Core for StyleSheet and GraphicalDisplayObject and fixed ShouldersCoreProject and coreBOs.
	2)  Need to remove DisplayObject from tables and ShouldersCoreProject.
	3)  Fix so that cancel on dialogs doesn't produce updates, etc.
	4)  Look at adds and deletes for PilotDialog.
	5)  Create new tables for WorkFlowDialog and test ( when get Rons stuff ).
	6)  See how much I can do using State interface instead of Site and link.
	7)  Rule, Field/XML Editor
	    a)  Select a Route
	    b)  Get the rules associated with the destination attribute
	    c)  have combo box showing events, etc.
	    d)  select a rule
	    e)  edit the "text" of the rule depending upon the evaluator
	    f)  save or cancel.
	    g)  Add a rule
	    	i)  Select an evaluator
	    	ii) Set the name of the rule
	    	iii)Set the parameters depending upon the evaluator
	    	iv) assign the rule to the route.


---20010329
	1)  Refactored to use reflection more and simplify logic
	2)  When creating new process, have menu item to setInitialActivity (see 3)
	3)  Always add a start and end activity when creating new process!!!
	4)  Getting error setting intialSubactivity ( type seems to be string)
	5)  To use RuleInfo in SelectionDialog, it must implement Accessible.


---20010418
	1)  Noticed that adding a field causes two to get added to the panel, but only one to get saved to the xml file in Pilot Editor.
		*** Fixed, see 8 below ***
	2)  Need to get rid of extraneous lines in the xml file when we write it out.
	3)  Start looking at how to parse out a rule from the expression.
		*** Work began 01-04-19 ***

	4)  Revisit the linking to see how to do it better(i.e. drag from A to B
	and have the panel pop up to set the name of the link).
	5)  For Rule parsing, find ruleinfo with name containing the class of the object
	6)  for each field in the object look in expression to see if field name occurs.  If does, put rule in list for field by evaluatorname?
	7)  select a field, select a rule on the field, show details, event name, etc.
	8)  Select a rule from the list of rule evaluators to add, fill in the
	parameters.

	NOTE:  Adding a route from left hand panel adds it twice on right!!!
		one is not "viable"
		*** Fixed 01-04-19 ***
			Was adding it twice!
	NOTE:  Removing a route from the right hand panel adds it to the left?
		adding or removing should not affect the left hand panel!!!
		*** Fixed 01-04-19 ***
			Removed updating left hand panel.


---20010419
	1)  Added a NewRuleEditor that is dummy for now.
		*** Fixed 01-04-20 ***
			edits rules now by routeName
	2)  It should get the class name and field name from the
		item display in the NewTemplateEditor
	3)  Should get list of Evaluators and for class being examined
		get from RouteMap the routeName and then the field
	4)  Locate any fieldname in the expressions that match the field name
		being displayed.
	5)  Need to be able to display the rulename and edit it also.
	6)  Review both TemplateEditor and RuleEditor for common things
		that could be improved.


---20010420
	1)  Doesn't appear that rules and scripts are happening on the web page
		when saving.  Perhaps rule exceptions aren't being caught.
	2)  boolean active/inactive not being set correctly.
	3)  Need to turn off caching for demos.
	4)  More rigourous testing.
	5)  Putting Beans in shared under jwooten for safety.


---20010425
	1)  RuleBuilder now parses Infix.  Need to pass evaluator name
		and parse accordingly.
	2)  Set last operator to " ";
	3)  Pass in operator to DisplayStrip.
	4)  Now assumes PERSON if method name passed.  Need to pass in class
		to build route name.
	5)  Add listeners to parameter area, and all combos.


---20010426
	1)  IP number at office is: 192.168.100.200,
		Netmask is: 255.255.255.0,
		Gateway is: 192.168.100.1
		DNS Server: 199.170.202.10
		Secondary:  205.152.0.8
	2)  Outside access to StarTeam is IP: 216.77.169.194

---20010507
	1)  Remember to look at Broker engine in xml again and figure out.
	2)  How to get list of all elements involved in a single "process"?
	3)  Send Ron article on workFlow.  Where is it?
	4)  Create spread sheet on Palm for flight log. running totals or such
	5)  Devise multithreaded test that runs one user until a process is queued
		then runs a second process for that user.
	6)  Devise multithreaded test that two different users run same process until scheduled for third user who services those requests.
	7)  getNextEntry for Queue looks like it won't work across servers.


---20010508
	1)  Need to eliminate objects as parents that aren't in the process, e.g. Do Home process, then do Edit and find that Edit is pointing to OK and Start is left hanging.  Perhaps don't add Start if "header" is already there?
	2)  Need to find missing links from activities to end
		and from processes to end.


---20010510
	1) When TransitionLink is edited or examined, then when it is redrawn, it doesn't display with the name!!!
	2)  process-end style is being put into style table more than once!
	*** Fixed in WorkFlowDelegate 01-05-11 ***
	3)  DUATS account number is: 10389178
		believe passwd to be: black1


---20010511
	1) When trying to add process, activity, or link, get
		SQL error.  Appears to be some problem with persistence.
	2) Deletes seem to be working and reconnecting links also.
	3) Added editing Template.  Seems marginally functional.


---20010514
	1)  Had to change Pilot and Logon to use session.getValue and session.putValue
		for present version of classPath.  No idea what conflict is.
	2)  Changed in Pilot and Logon the use of Action.ACTION to "Action".
	3)  Found that getSourceLocationPath in Pilot wasn't adding the language.


---20010515
	1) Refresh database
	2) Load Data java com.shoulderscorp.tests.pilot.LoadTestData
	3) startWebLogic
	4) start Browser
	5) do logon?action=logon&userID=user1&password=user1
	6) Create Person ( no address )
	7) Edit a Person ( no address unless already there )
	8) show cancel goes back to queue
	9) delete a person ( acknowledgement is queued )
	10) look at queue entry
	11) start java com.shoulderscorp.tests.navigatorMenu.javaDraw.JavaDrawSwingApp
	12) Process Create a Person
	13) select Process
	14) Show template name dbl click
	15) edit template
	16) Add Gender
	17) refresh lower page


---20010516
	1) Assign someone to build a logging package for our framework.
	2) Edit Editor to have it build a set of Links to couple the "Business Process" together.  i.e. each thing in the BP is linked directly to the BP during the building.
	3) Start with writing the build process first, then be able to find them and visualize them.  DO NOT refer to the TransitionLinks directly, but rather use the getNextActions and get outputs.
	4) Clean up the other classes so they know nothing of the objects ( business objects ).


---20010517
	1) To do a demo, stopped trying on drawing link and filling in data, but using
		the drop then link icon, then link it up.
		***IDEA***
		Make the ActivityDependency ( which is a connector! ) actuall already have from connector to LinkFigure and a to Connector.  When mouse down
		connect from connector to source.  When mouse up, connect to Connector to target.  THEN pop up the item to get the data for the label.  Create
		the TransitionInput and assign it to the new TransitionLink and archive.  Then create GDO and put object into it and archive.
	2)  When we connect an activity to an output label (transitionlink), we're not
		updating the parent and child of the underlying transitionLink.
		We should use the delegate of the gdo for that.
		*** Fixed ***
	3)  When an existing process is selected, we are asked to fill in name, etc.
		shouldn't be.
		***Fixed***
	4)  Need to add creating a new Template with Template Name if one doesn't exist.
	5)  Make it possible to load an existing one and edit it saving under another name.
	6)  When showing TransitionLinks, they aren't showing their label, but after moving them on screen, they do!!
		***Fixed or at least identified*** need to do moveBy(-1,-1) and (1,1)


---20010518
	1)  Missing Transition Information for Vacation Request tells me that there
		are some other parameters needed.  Look at ini files and see what else to add to Transition Links


---20010521
	1)  Create a DisplayFieldDefinition to hold
		a)  methodName
		b)  DefaultScreenLabel
		c)  dataType
		d)  categoryName if c is categoryItem
		e)  readOnly flag
		f)  className for gathering if object reference
		g)  queryString for gathering
	2)  Create a DisplayFieldHandler to build a hashTable by
		ScreenName ( i.e. activityName ) with each entry being a vector of
		fields in the order to be presented.  This handler reads a csv file in
		that defines the processName,methodName,label,dataType,... and
		uses lazy startup.  First time accessed, reads the file.
	3)  Create an AttributeDisplay that uses the DisplayFieldHandler to
		create and edit the list of attributes.  Put a browser button
		beside the entries that are not primitives.  Put an inspect button that
		shows the attribute in another AttributeDisplay.
	4)  Create a Browser that uses the className and queryString to gather the list
		to select from for replacing the item.
	5)  Need to create a generic object with an attribute that can
		take additional attributes.
		a)  GenericObject obj = new GenericObject("VacationRequest");
		b)  obj.addAttributeList(vector displayfieldDefinitions);
		c)  How to make it so that it can be "cloned"?  i.e. when
			one creates a new one it gets the attributes?
		d)  Then need panel to create new object
			i)  set className = attribute
			ii) display attributes and set values ( use AttributePanel );
		e)  Add static methods to retrieve by attribute value.



---20010523
	1)  New getGDOs doesn't require the attributed Link.  I need to remove that
		from createProcess, and linkObj
	2)  New getGDOs isn't traversing the tree yet to get the next lower level.
		it needs to stop when it hits a process
	3)  LinkFigure isn't changing back to yellow when the end is connected.
		***Fixed***
	4)  Need to extend getGDOs to get rest of info.
	5)  Check creating Vacation Request as process, then linking it up.

	1)  Checked in all Rons version and labeled as v0.9
	2)  Note to ron telling him to finish dequeuing and if possible timed queue and multiple database connections.
	3)  Password on netplx is should1!



---20010617
	1) Flow of control for workflowtracking should be:

		if ( qMarkQueueEntryComplete() )
		    {
			markQueueEntryComplete();
		    }
		    if ( qPushToChildActivity() )
		    {
			if ( pushToChildActivity() )return;
		    }
		    if ( qPopToParentActivity() )
		    {
			if( popToParentActivity() )return;
		    }
		    if ( qQueueToTargetSupplier() )
		    {
			    if( queueToTargetSupplier() )return;
		    }
		    if ( qPerformCurrentActivity() )
		    {
			    if( performCurrentActivity() )return;
		    }
		    if ( qMoveToPlannedNextActivity() )
		    {
			    if( moveToPlannedNextActivity() ) return;
		    }

	2)  qMarkQueueEntryComplete -- Determines if the current activity has produced
		and outcome.  If it hasn't then don't mark it completed. else do and proceed.
	3)  qPushToChildActivity -- Determine if the current activity is in fact a
		business process and if so push to child activity and return.
	4)  qPopToParentActivity -- Determine if the "end" of the activity chain
		for this business process has been reached.  If it has, then pop to the
		parent activity and return;
	5)  qQueueToTargetSupplier -- Determine if this activity should be queued.  If
		so, then queue it to the proper target and return.
	6)  qPerformCurrentActivity -- Determine if the current activity is to be
		executed.  If so, do it, and if sucessful return.
	7)  qMoveToPlannedNextActivity -- Determine if a move to the planned
		next activity is possible.  If it is, move to it, and then return.

	In the previous incarnation of the workflow tracker, this was done recursively.
	When the "state" of the tracker was saved, then that produced a call to advance
	the workFlowTracker.  That advance was a call to this method above.  Internally
	as a move was made to a new activity or a push was made to a child activity,
	the state was saved, producing another call to the routine.  At some point, the process produced a return rather than a new save, that caused the "stack" then
	to start unwinding and finally led to the completion of the "process" including
	all nested work that was being done.

	8)  In the current incarnation, the "state" is saved in the ProcessContext, I believe.  How is it handling this "stacking"?  How does it pop and push?  Is it
	recursive?


---20010618

	1)  Added an AlienBio process.
		Got the list of "aliens" to come up with the proper buttons, BUT
		clicking the Cancel takes me back to the Queue, but doesn't remove the
		entry from the queue.  Should it?

		Clicking the OK should take me to a modified Person page, but it does
		not, instead going back to the queue also.  DB appears right, will look
		at it in editor.
	2)  Edited the Alien html and xml to include an extra table.  Will try to
		make that show a list of dependents using a qualifier.  Also need
		button on the list that takes one to a child editor.  Do this for
		all the tables.  After editing, we return to the bio page.



---20010702

	1)  Remember to install latest Fly By Pro.  It's in FlyByNav folder.
	2)  Then turn of CASL conduit, via HotSync/Custom/CASL/change/doNothing.


---20010717

	1)  To run the junit test, do:
		d:
		cd junit3.2
		java -cp d:\junit3.2\junit.jar;. junit.ui.TestRunner
		Note that . can be replace by other directory to use as base.

		In window type packagename and classname of
		test package.  e.g. in above junit.samples.TestAll

		Test will run.
		Or better still use
		java -cp d:\junit3.2\junit.jar;. junit.swingui.TestRunner which has a combo box with history.
	2) Large repository of tests located at:

		d:\f_drive\burrt_September30_desktop\HANIBAAL\Source\TestJava\com\adp\pcpitest ( sent to Chris H today ).



---20010718

	1)  To run test cases, do:

		in command window, d:, cd d:\weblogic; setenv;
		cd Projects\tests

		D:\Projects\tests\expeditor\coercion>javac -classpath d:\ICS_WEBAPP\Web-inf\clas
		ses;d:\junit3.2\junit.jar;. com\shoulderscorp\tests\expeditor\coercion\*.java

		Then in another command window
		d:
		cd junit3.2
		java -cp d:\junit3.2\junit.jar;d:\ICS_WEBAPP\Web-inf\classes;d:\Projects\tests;. junit.swingui.TestRunner

		In the window enter com.shoulderscorp.tests.expeditor.coercion.CoerceTest


		a:  Coercion converted and tested.



---20010724

	1)  Created com.shoulderscore.tests.user with
		a) TestUser
		b) TestUserApplication

	2)  TestUserApplication creates a named object set if
		the given methodName derived from the route doesn't
		exist. and retrieves the same way.
		Useful in adding attributes to objects on the fly.
	3)  Need to fix expeditor so that IF a route name is not given, then try to use the swap the class.class.name
	for the routename somehow so that it looks up Person.lastName or lastName if Person isn't there.


---20010725

	1)  In getRoute of RouteMap, if no routes exist, could we
		see if the ClassName is first and matches the origin className and then if so, return the wholde string?

	2)  Created UserSession which will be a qualified child of
		User.  This maintains the login time, the lastAccess time, and the sessionId.
	3)  It remains to be done that the navigator should not
		assume a User object to get the name from, but
		rather any object.  If it is UniquelyIdentifiable,
		then it uses it ObjectIdentifier as the "name" of the object.  If done correctly, then a user can have
		several sessions.  Their navigator is on a session basis.  When the user logs in, any expired user sessions and any old navigators for those sessions
		are removed.  Does this break anything?  Do processes assume that a navigator remains around
		for them?  It doesn't seem that they should.
		Navigators should pick up process Contexts and advance them. Why should they hold information?


---20010726

	1)  Add field to DatabaseOptions of applicationName
	2)  Add accessors to DatabaseOptionsInterface
	3)  fix places where it is implemented.
	4)  In StandardDatabaseAdapter and TOPLinkDatabaseAdapter,
		pull out the application name and use it
		to locate the project file (always called Project)
		and load it in the open method.
	5)  Write a test to open one, close, open another, close, etc.
	6)  Today Phil delivered new database and project file.  The project file needs to be in the TOOLS directory, but gets put into the com.shoulderscorp.adapters.dataio.TOPLink when it is compiled.
	7)  Login isn't catching duplicate logins!
	8)  Logout isn't even seeing things.
	9)  Make UserSession implement Notifiable and register it
		when we login.  Then be sure that we provide
		an event called OUTPUT_GENERATION_PENDING and one
		called OUTPUT_GENERATION_COMPLETE and one called
		INPUT_DATA_RECEIVED, INPUT_DATA_COMPLETE
		have UserSession update itself during some of these events if they are for the current user?
	10) When logging in, remove any expired UserSessions.


---20010727

	1)  Found that getChildRelations(class) doesn't work.
	2)  getChildRelations("String") does.
	3)  apparently removeChildRelation(obj,qualifier)
		does not get rid of the link, it just uncouples it.
		need to destroy the link.
		Create a test to verify this.


---20010808

	1)  Need UserSession added to ics.mdb and to ShouldersCoreProject
	2)  How to start and stop TomCat


---20010814

	1)  Downloaded JGraph and GraphEdit.  Need to install and test.
	2)  The JobTracker Test isn't getting the NextActivity via the network links correctly.  Probably a query problem again.
	3)  TransitionInput.activate and QueueEntryStatus.activate both fail in the queries.


---20010815

	1)  Move the workflow and workflow tracker tests to the
		tests package and reference them properly.
	2)  Create the MemoryAdapter tests and get it fixed
		so that the activate query works.


---20010820

	1)  Memory Adapter is failing.  Do I need to set the evaluators as in ExpressionEvaluatorTest

	1)  DefaultQueueingPolicy, isSchedulable controls queing.
		if( true ) QueueEntry etc. are created.
	2)  ICSApplicationTest has nested start transaction and
		thus you don't see the changes in the database
		unless you turn them off.
	3)  ICSLogon Servlet maybe doesn't set up Roles such that
		User.activate(userName).getRoles() returns the
		roles that the user has.
	4)  Somewhere we hit the statement
		initiatingActorRole.isIn(list of roles) and that
		throws exception when no roles in list.


---20010907

	1)  I should define an ArchiverPolicy that is initially
		implemented in a DefaultArchiverPolicy.  An ArchiverPolicy is provided to allow different objects to be archived different ways.  The DefaultArchiverPolicy hands all objects to the normal archiver class that is provided.  However in some cases some classes might be "persisted" in memory while others are in the database.  At startup, the ICSArchiverPolicy would read in the data to create in memory the necessary work flows, etc.  When an attempt is made to query for those objects, the policy would dictate that those queries be done in memory.
	2)  This would be provided as an ApplicationObject and used
		if provided.  If not provided, the DefaultPolicy would be used.
	3)  Wrap RuleEvaluators up as EJBs, make the Regulator a
		Servlet that dispatches to the proper EvaluatorEJBs.  Rules would be read in at initializion of the Servlet time?
	4)  Make the WorkFlow also a Servlet or Bean that manages
		everything in memory?
	5)  I made the queuing work by setting schedulable=true everywhere in the ICS_Workflow.ini file and by setting the defaultActor in ICSLogon.java. In the test, I had to be sure to create actors, set Default actor, etc.
	Status seems to switch from Ready, completed, active, ...
	NOT SURE WHAT THESE MEAN YET.
	6)  Create a test to queue something up.  The stop server
	restart and run test to dequeu that thing and continue.


---20010908

	1)  Initial Setup of an application.
		a)  Roles:  Define roles that differentiate
			behaviors, e.g. Mgr, SiteUser, CustomerUser, ICSUser.  Each has
			different responsibilities and can
			perform different tasks or start different business processes(a collection of tasks, some of which may be delegated to different roles themselves).
		b)  WorkCenters: Define workcenters where different
			kinds of activities are carried out.  Examples would be a siteWC, a customerEC, or ICSWC.  In another application they might be Personnel, HumanRelations, Medical, Security, etc.  They might be workCenters within departments. I.e. the Personnel department might have a ProfessionalHiring WorkCenter, an HourlyHiring Workcenter, etc.  Workcenters
			have normalInitiatingActorRoles.  That is the role that an actor must have to initiate businessProcesses from that workcenter.  WorkCenters contain their own queues where work is queued for action by people working in that work center.
		c)  BusinessProcesses:  Assign businessProcesses to
			the appropriate workCenters.  Thus people working in a particular work center will be able to start processes within that work center.  The process they initiate might be performed entirely within the initiating workcenter or it might have parts that are queued to other workCenters or actors.
		d)  Users: Create users and create actors for each
			role that the user might perform.  I.e. RalphAsSiteUser, RalphAsCustomerUser.
			Assign one actor as the users defaultActor.
		e)  Logon: Obtain the users userID and password.
			Determine if the user is valid and can login( what is the login policy?).  If they can login, then get the roles in which the user can act.  With that set of roles, determine to which workcenters the user belongs.  From that set of workcenters, obtain the collection of business Processes that can be initiated.  Create a menuBar, businessProcess list, tabs, etc. as desired to allow the user to select the business processes they wish to start.  In the menubar, have a way to look at queuedTasks and perhaps a counter of tasks awaiting.
			The presentation of this depends upon the customers desires for look and feel. You might also decide to only present the information for a single role ( the default role for the user ) but have a combo box to allow them to change roles.  When a role change occurs, then the menuBar changes.
			Often the menuBar contains identifying information about user, role, etc.  The display panel for specific activities, then contains either the task list or a "welcome" page with system information or message of the day.
		f)  BusinessProcessInitialization:  When a business
			process is selected from the menubar, it is handed to the Servlet ( ICSServlet ).  The default isSchedulable attribute on TransitionLinks should be "true".  This will cause activities to be queued and dequeued and allow transitions between roles.
		g)  TaskList:  The ShowQueue page would contain all
			tasks that are active and queued to either a role in which the user can act or one of the users actors itself.  Selecting one of
			these tasks, should then cause the task to be "dequeued" and presented on the screen exactly as if it had not be queued, but just moved to as the next activity.

	If the application is set up this way, then each business process has an end.  Upon reaching that end, the return is to the "home" state, which is the display of the task list or message state with the menubar ready for additional work.  It probably would not be necessary to have actions to find the top state, etc.  The login contains no specific knowledge of the roles, etc. and additions, changes, etc are all part of the data that is loaded into the database or created by other screens.  If we wished to add an additional Role to the ICS application, we would go to the maintainance screen, create the role, create workcenters, create business processes, assign the role to users ( creating actors in the process ).  When a user with that role logged in, the new processes, etc. would be there ready to run.


---20010909

	1)  Expression did not get saved when created new rule.
	2)  Rule name did not get changed.
	3)  RuleInfo was created.


---20010912

	1)  BOMPanel now works for adding new Items to P1  and positioning them under other items using the "childOf" and
		for inserting an existing item under a child.  What doesn't work is creating a new product.  Going to
		change the AddNewItem to a combo box
		with Add New Item and Add New Product.
		*** Fixed ***
	2)  Don't include non-leaf nodes in summary.
		*** Fixed ***
	3)  parentOf should probably use Node list to walk up rather
		than BOMs since we want to walk up the tree.
	4)  Delete gave a classCast Exception in generateTableData.
		*** Fixed ***
	5)  Delete doesn't redraw tree.
	6)  Added QuantityClass for combining amount and UOM.
		Should use in many classes where UOM should be required.


---20010915

	1)  Install new TomCat from zipped File in downloads.
		Follow Jasons instructions in his email.
	2)  Download latest ICS code and check diffs for framework.
	3)  Define new BOM.  Products contain items and other products
		A Product can be asked for its BOM.  The BOM
		is a collection of the items with their levels?, the BOM can be summarized, sorted by fields,
		and summarized at different levels?  A BOM can be asked whereUsed and we should return the inverted BOM.  might be that we just define an operation invert and an isInverted so we can just invert it.  Then we can implement a whereUsed easily.
	4)  Create a Test case using Product, Item, and the new BOM to
		specify what the expected behavior is.
	5)  Make BusinessProcess a subclass of Activity.
	6)  In Activity put the rules that:
		a)  If there are no outcomes, then the action is performed and a return to the previous activity is done.
		b)  If a transitionLink has a null child, then a pop is made to the parent of the process the activity is a part of.
	7)  Change the linkage so that transition links are attached to
		"nodes", which have an Activity, and a processName.
		This will require changes in lots of places including the editor.
	8)  Why doesn't the workFlowEditor work?
	9)  Paid bills.
	10) Shoulders Address:
		Shoulders Corp.
		555 Heritage Rd.
		Suite 100
		Southbury CT 06488


---20010928

	1)  The ObjectBox isn't setting the selection to the current
		address in our example.  It might be that I have a > in the field and its trying to match the name. Try removing that and putting only the oid in the field.
	2)  The result of changing the object box doesn't appear to be
		transmitted down to the saving in passivate.  Put some
		statements in and trace it.  The address should get set.


---20010929

	1)  Check with FlyBy to see which one is the best one to use and what the instructions are to get that one installed and only that one. Check what the ID numbers are also.
	2)  Set up voice recog for Home, Dianne, Jag, Rachel, Tom, Headquarters, Office, Tim, Denny, Lawrence, Jo, TomHome.
	3)  Set up email addresses for Tom, Tim, John Farmer, etc.
	4)  Found that if I deleted ics_webapp/classes/com.. then
		regened the ics project only, that I couldn't run.  Then
		tried to recreate the projects and couldn't.  Many things are not consistent!!  A checkout should always compile and should always work.


---20010930

 	1)  See if there are expression evaluators in Regulator or such that could be used as defaults.


---20011002

 	1)  Added ability to use Query and Arguments to ObjectBox, also
 		specify display string and "formatting" (crude)
 	2)  Can use this as alternative to ComboBox with query. See
 		documentation in ActivateInstance.
 	3)  Clean up documentation on this.
 	4)  Develop a DTD for ActivityInstance, etc.
 	5)  Created an emptyservletproject that should be a template
 		for next project.
 	6)  Test this by creating:
 		a)  Producer ( project that uses framework to set up
 			ini files, etc.) Graphics editor is part of this.
 		b)  ShouldersHR (project useing framework to manage
 			our Vacations, etc.



---20011003

 	1)  How to run BOM Panel Demo

---20011004

	1)  Downloaded javaMail and jaf ( java bean activation)
		these need to be installed in classpath for
			vm?
	2)  Wrote TimedEventTask and Mailer for ICS
	3)  Need to Put the jpgs on our server so we can use them in
		word documents.


---20011005

	1)  Test BillOfMaterials in NetBeans to trace why I'm not getting
		the quantity right.  Appears to not be locating link.


---20011008

	1)  Met with James Houghton, Director of Applications and Development
	2)  He provided an outline of Technology Planning that I copied and forwarded to Tom.
	3)  We discussed Item 1 and Jo LaTorre emailed me a zip file of their development documents.
	4)  We discussed how to get the effort going by starting a small project, and looking out two more out-projects.  Figure out the commonality, establish a base architecture, and start on some interfaces.
	5)  James would like to do a Table Editor and Admin system, but it has to be done my Jan 1 and they are leaning towards VB and hack it out for now.  This is a system for assigning Roles and user access and then sending that to the LDAP system and also editing tables that contain "labels" or codes, much like our CategoryItem.
	6)  They think this is one person for 2.5 months.  Could we convince them the way to start is with 2 people ( 3? ) here building system using most of their information, but setting up Java Environment, starting architecture, and xTreme programming with 1 or 2 of their people to do this by that date?
	7) I demoed StarTeam and they were very impressed.  They said the factory rep didn't do it as well and they had not been impressed.  I was showing them over a 28.8 modem and it looked great.  Our projects bug tracking, task lists, topic lists along with the Build and release levels and the promotion was a great hit.  We could help them set this up for J2EE.
	8)  They need an architecture.  That is really what is missing.  You can't get reuse if you don't have common abstractions, etc.
	9)  Who do we pitch the startup project to and get a quick answer.  What price?  What would get us in the door???



---20011010

	1)  Need to add more documentation to many items in BusinessObjects.
	2)  Check that BillOfMaterials compiles.  If it works, that would be better.
		*** Fixed compilation, but not tested yet 01-10-10 ***
	3)  Create the XML handler from the html page I have saved.
		*** Done 01-10-10 tested in Netbeans ***
	4)  Start the HR project for Shoulders.
	5)  Do a fresh checkout.
		*** Done 01-10-10 ***
	6)  Where do we stand on the Expeditor Project?
	7)  Where is the task spreadsheet?
		*** on web see mail for address ***
	8)  Add caching to the XML and HTML reading by providing
		a reader through the application.  Lazy instantiation
		of a language.
	9)  Compiled and tested briefly the BrokerEngine.  It reads from
		d:\Projects\Framework\Tests\com\shoulderscorp\core\Sample.xml
		and writes to c:\Netbeans\123.xml
	10) Redo all settings etc. for netbeans.  I have a new version and lost the original settings.


---20011011

	1)  Registered with sun to get Forte, j.wooten with normal password.
	2)  Need to download and compare to NetBeans
		*** Downloaded, not installed yet. ***


---20011017

	1)  Downloaded JBoss and installed it.  Moved old tomcat web.xml
		into the JBoss/tomcat location.
	2)  Downloaded Ant and installed it.  Then JBoss worked!
	3)  Trying to figure out which port JBoss/Tomcat uses.
	4)  Got the JBoss working by creating a JBOSS_ADDS environment
		variable.  I set it to d:\ICS_WEBAPP\WEB-INF\LIB\xerces.jar; d:\ICS_WEBAPP\WEB-INF\LIB\xalan.jar;d:\ICS_WEBAPP\WEB-INF\LIB\sunxml.jar
		Then in Jboss\...\jboss\run.bat we put
		set JBOSS_CLASSPATH=%JBOSS_CLASSPATH%;%JBOSS_ADDS%

		This solved the problem of the class loader not being to find sun.com.xml.Parser.  Apparently their loader doesn't load a "child" or such.  Here it gets loaded


---20011030

	1)  Downloaded nullcraft and installed it.  This is supposedly a
		portal extension to Apache.
	2)  Downloaded mySql and installed it.  This is a database that is
		used by nullcraft.  It appears to be there and working.
	3)  Haven't gotten nullcraft/Dispatch to work yet.  apparently the database isn't set up correctly.  Have sent email for what to do.
	4)  Corrected the build.bat file for nullcraft.  It was missing the %CP%; in the second line of defines of CP.
	5)  Ant appears to work fine for builds.  Need to let Cary know.
	6)  Updated invoices, etc.
	7)  Still need to update Balance Sheet and a few others.


---20011031

	1)  Installed OpenPortal on system.  Seems to point to urls on the
		network for tags that can't be located.  Emailed author to
		see wtf is intended here.
		*** getting some resultes, still errors though
		     installed war file under jboss and it seemed to deploy!
	2)  Need to get info from session in jspHelper and put it back in when
		we do the save or new.  This information is only for jspHelper
		so that it will work better in the Portal Environment.
		*** Completed on 011101, Rule creation doesn't work after
		    first failure as there is a duplicate rule with the same
		    empty name.  Change rule to not check if ruleName is empty.
	3)  Need to fix New in the jspHelper.  I think this might be due to
		the missing session info.
		*** Done on 011101 ***
	4)  Need to create ShouldersCoreProject that has only core classes in it.
	5)  All Framework component tests should use non-project specific project
		file and components.
	6)  BOM needs a new association class HierarchicalAssociation? with a quantity.


---20011101

	1)  Installed JBoss templates.
	2)  Test code works but can't create new test cases.  Check if netbeans component will work here.
	3)  Haven't figured out how to create an EJB yet.


---20011102

	1)  Created DragAndDrop folder in OtherFiles/DragAndDrop.  Need to see if I can create a vector of connections for each image and then remove the connections, move the box and redraw the connections.  How to draw a line between 2 points?

	2)  Created ContainerManaged EJB Projects\JBossEntityTest that
		uses a jsp called UserClient.jsp under
		http://localhost:8080/entityTest.  Note that this uses
		InstantDB.

	3)  Added ins to d:\webapplications\ins.  Put latest SCFramework.jar into it.
		It fails during archiver open or so.  Track down.
		*** Fixed on 01-11-03 *** Was missing the Project in Application.


---20011103

	1)  Need to see how to use the EJB I created in JBossEntityTest via
		the Archiver, so that we can use routes, etc and use it with
		ListDetail.  One thought is to make the OID be the
		shortClassName:int.  Then in Archiver have an EJB Adapter.
		In the EJBAdapter, strip off the shortClassName and look up
		the actual className.  Use that to get the home and use the shortClassName:int as the key to get the actual object.  Now, one thought is to have the lookup table that has the long className, also have the superclass.  That way, we could get the classHierarchy, then
		go through it backwards, getting lowest level, next, etc. copying in the attributes as we go.  Thus User would know its class is com.shoulderscorp.core.businessobjects.User.  It would then get Users superClass, Associate and on up to base class.  create base class, create next class and copy base class attributes into it, create next and copy those into it, etc.   Have to be careful how this is done as you want the higher level overrides to not be overwritten as you get the superclasses values.

	2)  How to use Container Management with another database?
	3)  What is the workflow from INS?  Do we show a queue?


---20011107

	1)  Copied down reference version of JDK 2.0 (has server, deployment tool, database, etc.  Also got example connection tools ( in Otherfiles/sample ).

	2)  Corrected some problems in ics/jsp's and solutiondesigner/jsp's.
	3)  Need to correct workflow for solutiondesigner.  Add getSelected after the
		list detail or a selection screen. then view the capabilities.
	4)  Created stub of Producer.  It needs to use Task to define a new Project.
		a)  ListDetail of Tasks that are children of MasterTask, to view current tasks and allow creation of new one.
		b)  Create a Screen ( assign it to an Activity, assign an action,
			assign fields from a multiselect, then edit features of each.
		c)  Create an action to dump ini files from a particular task.
		d)  Need to edit java files in /producer.  Make sure they are correct.
		e)  Recompile them.  Change project name in bat file.


---20011109

	1)  Installed Soap v2.2 under JBoss.  Seems to work reasonably well.  Had
		to change the classpath, but got it working.  Check that other
		apps aren't affected as it jiggered the xml parsers in the
		Classpath and in tomcat.bat, but I don't think that one is used.


---20011121

	1)  Change Application so that it has a register and unRegister method
		These take the application instance and register it using
		the currentThread as the key.  Then the get instance method
		uses the currentThread to get the threads threadHash and
		from that extracts the application instance.
		unRegister removes the currentThread information.
		* * * FIXED * * * 011206
	2)  Create a ShouldersServlet that extends HttpServlet and makes
		the doPost final.  We also have two methods that are abstract:
		a)  postIt, which the implementer must implement.  Here are the specifics for the doPost method.  Note that the doPost method in
		ShouldersServlet has
		{
			register();
			postIt();
			unRegister();
		b)  register, where the implmenter must provide the application instance to the Application.register(myApplicationInstance).
		Can I use the setInstance method instead?
		* * * FIXED * * * 011206
	3)  Now, ICS Login and ICS Servlet each extend ShouldersServlet
		in the  postIt method they do what is not done in the default doPost
		method.  Provide the register method.
		* * * FIXED * * * 011206
	4)  register might just be setInstance instead?
		* * * DECIDED TO MAKE REGISTER SEPARATE * * * see Application


---20011128

	1)  Fix mgmtroi servlet so that it detects crossing and scales to 2 x that.
	2)  Create a servlet that does the project estimation.  Create a class to do the calculation depending upon the inputs.  That way we can use it with the new Producer.


---20011130

	1)  In Notify, adding Listeners should somehow be for this applicationName ONLY.  An XMLMessenger might post messages for other applications, BUT it itself is a part of the notification system for the same application that is doing the notification.  The only outside application notification would be via an XMLMessenger.
	Check Notify so that it adds and notifies listeners for events that are in the same application.
	2)  It appears that I should store the application object in a hash called userHash that has a key "application", a key "user", a key "...", where
	other information is kept. The eventSource should be there as the "eventSource".
		* * * FIXED * * * 011206
	3)  Get rid of a lot of printouts and change to using session for session tracking.  Still need to know how to keep the context information.  The navigator can't be referenced in the ProcessContext.  But the role should be.
		* * * FIXED * * * 011206
	4)  Add the getRoles(User user), getBusinessProcesses(Role role).
	5)  Add the startProcess(String processName).
	6)  Set up a menu based default for showing either all processes for all roles or the processes for a given role.
	7)  There should be a screen that allows the user to specify the
	menu category and the items under that menu?  Then that gets stored for that user as their configuration.


---20011201

	1)  getResponse appears in ShouldersServlet and in ICSLogon.  Can they
		be combined into ShouldersServlet and referred to in ICSLogon?
	2)  startProcess seems to be the present postIt.  Given the proper data
		in the request, we will start the process?
	3)  Logon, then needs to have the information to build the menus
		based upon the roles of the user.  Would like to create a factory or
		such here that reads in the class that will build the logon information and present it.  That way the same logon can be reused
		with different presentations of the information.


---20011203

	1)  Modifications in Application, JspHelper, ShouldersServlet and ICS.
		creating a sessionInfo hash that should have user information in it.
		PROBLEM...Don't appear to have a userId at many points in the code when starting a thread.  WHY???? should have one!!!!!
		* * * FIXED * * * 011206

	2)  Need to modify the userId in the session so that it contains a key to either the sessionID or the ApplicationName.
		* * * FIXED * * * 011206


---20011204

	1)  Installed jetspeed and then changed the Email notifier to eliminate the
		Integer setting of the userid.  Got it to print out info so
		I can use it.  Don't get portlet setup info as I get an xml parser
		error.
	2)  CLASSPATH normally used: D:\TIBCO\TIBRV\LIB\tibrvj.jar;d:\Projects\Framework\jars\xerces.jar;d:\Projects\Framework\jars\xalan.jar;d:\Projects\Framework\jars\sunxml.jar;d:\Projects\Framework\jars\mail.jar;d:\Projects\Framework\jars\activation.jar;d:\junit3.7\junit.jar;d:\jdk1.3.0_02\jre\lib\rt.jar;d:\Projects\MgmtRoi\Source\Java;.
	3)  Trying new CLASSPATH:
	D:\TIBCO\TIBRV\LIB\tibrvj.jar;d:\Projects\Framework\jars\mail.jar;d:\Projects\Framework\jars\activation.jar;d:\junit3.7\junit.jar;d:\jdk1.3.0_02\jre\lib\rt.jar;d:\Projects\MgmtRoi\Source\Java;.

	4)  Above new CLASSPATH SEEMS TO work with test apps.
	5)  Need to edit ins to agree with new framework and extend class correctly.
		it is proabably using old SCFrame.jar!!!
	6)  INS corrected BUT it has database descriptors for OLD Request object.
	7)  Need to install TOPLink builder and fix the INS database.


---20011206

	1)  Checked in versions of Application, DefaultProcessRolePolicy, Shoulders
		Servlet, ICSServlet, Logon, and ICSApplication that are
		consistent and appear to work.  Earlier had checked in a JspHelper
		that worked with the new version of Application.
		* * * This might have impact upon Expeditor -- check * * *

	2)  Check these printout statements:

---20011212

	1)  JBOSS_ADDS is an environment variable so that our ics application
		will work.  We apparently use the sun.xml parser in our
		reading of xml.  We should replace this with the xerces one
		soon.  BUT in the maintime, it has have sunxml.jar listed there.
		For some reason, having it in the ics/lib doesn't work.  Removing
		the xerces.jar from the JBOSS_ADDS also breaks the ejb handling
		for JBoss.
	2)  Create a new servlet JspNavigator which does JspNavigation.
		All Jsps call JspNavigator passing in their
		name, form_data will be in the request, and the button pressed
		should also be there as Action.action?  The JspNavigator
		will initialize itself via an XML file that describes the
		"site map".  That data will be used to match the current
		jspName and Action.action to determine which is the next jsp.
		The jsp can get the outcomes by asking JspNavigator for its outcomes!
		Format is:

		<workflow>
		<action tag="Login" name="Login.jsp" />
			<outcome name="Login" action="ShowQueue.jsp"/>
			<outcome name="Cancel" action="Login.jsp"/>
		</action>

		<action tag="ShowQueue" name="ShowQueue.jsp"/>
			<outcome name="Select" action="DeQueue.jsp"/>
		</action>

		<action tag="Admin" name="Admin.jsp" />
			<outcome name="Edit Users" action="jspUserListDetail.jsp" />
			<outcome name="Edit People" action="jspPersonListDetail.jsp" />
			<outcome name="Edit Roles" action="jspRoleListDetail.jsp" />
			<outcome name="Edit Rules" action="jspRuleListDetail.jsp" />
			<outcome name="Edit Routes" action="jspRouteListDetail.jsp" />
		</action>

		</workflow>


---20011218

	1)  Create a Test case for StandardDatabaseAdapter.
		a)  Create StandardDatabaseOptions,
		b)  Adapter
		c)  Then open.  Should read in ShouldersCorp.dbm
		d)  Then getDescriptor from adapter and check.

	2)  Finish JDBCAdapter.  It should return a Document object
		from the getEventData.


---20011220

	1)  Need to move the common behaviors of dumping subscriptions etc. from XMLPsAdapter to Adapter.
	2)  Need way for general adapter to dump its stuff and then
	dump specific stuff.  Perhaps there could be additional
	parameters when it sets up subscription for logging.


---20011221

	1)  Need to check in code changes.
	2)  Check the boolean expression strings for correctness.
	3)  Document.
	4)  Pass back the record that violated the rule?
	5)  Message should show rule violated and for which
		record.  And then get action and display.


---20011224

	1)  Put new .xx. operators into ExpressionSyntaxAn.java
	    Not sure parsing correctly since gives same error
	    whether value is or is not null.  ?
