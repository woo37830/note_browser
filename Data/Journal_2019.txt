Created a branch 'experiment' off of master for SignalR.
Working in branch 'refactor' off of fix-sftp for getting processes ready for Maestro.

ERC balking.  Lorien and Mark to negotiate with ERC.  Might not get
paid until Feb or March.  Need to meet criteria for Production Certificate.

---20190104 11:54:41
Added if test in BREAccountsLoader to check if account row read belongs to
a particular client ( 'CTR1T' ).  If it does not, then skip.
DJ says later we might test against a list of clients and do the same.  
I worry about changing the client file as it will create lots of logging 
of missing clients.  This was all done in the fix-sftp branch and checked int.
Working on maestro where I'm trying to create a notification system so
that processes can be started and stopped from a controlling web-app.
Also, in refactor, I'm working to remove the main class from all of the 
apps and be able to use them in the maestro project without their main's.
Having problems with reading in the json data in the MVC_Maestro class
to create the jQuery datatable.

---20190104 20:23:00
Approved pull request for the PostBootSetup.bat #87 fix.

---20190104 21:53:11
Fixed Issue #90 where BETWEEN is to be inclusive to match MSSQL.
Deleted fix_between branch after testing and uploading code to github
and executable to camlsftp for DJ.
Now working in refactor where I'm trying to get Json to create DataTable

---20190105 06:15:28
Caffeine has a new version that runs on Mojave.  I have installed it on va-air.

---20190105 06:27:54
In AllTests, I added an Adjust method to replace blanks in the Json
headers with an underscore.  Be sure to put this into the MVC code.

---20190105 07:59:55
Replaced complex GetColumnNames in queryEngine with list of column names
and tested.  Mailed results in slack to DJ, then committed and pushed.
Also, moved latest build #181 of queryEngine to camlsftp for DJ and
informed him.

---20190105 08:15:49
Updated the ~/bin/search and todo_updater.pl scripts to find .todo and .diary

---20190105 08:18:58
Found that the blank line created a blank line in the diary script

---20190105 22:12:19
branch logging was being used to fix the logging in RemotingServer and also to
add logging to queryEngine separating timing for decrypting and loading.

---20190110 21:04:21
Fixed liquidprompt to show the history number line 1736
    PS1="${PS1}${LP_PWD}${LP_BRACKET_CLOSE}${LP_VENV}${LP_PROXY}\!>"
Helped DJ get a version with just the consistent build 119 from 118 but Tools IsReal in there.

---20190111 16:51:50
Created client-list branch off of fully merged develop, added HashSet clientList and 
checked for key 'current_clients_file' in configuration file, etc.  committed
and pushed, then PR created to merge with develop.

---20190115 17:08:46
Fixed TPLink and changed router to use channel 1 seems better

---20190117 21:16:25
Found bug 126 in develop stream.  Lines 201, 215.  Created issue
then saved QueryEngine.cs, CreateTable.cs, RemotingServer.cs to Desktop
and reset develop to remote values.  Then removed -D fix_115.
Then did git checkout -b fix-126 develop, copied in the QueryEngine.cs
I had corrected.  Found that Visual Studio doesn't pick up the changed
file when it was checked out!  Had to close it and reopen it.  Then
after verifying I was back at the start, I copied the QueryEngine back into
the code, built and verified it was correct.  Then committed, pushed to the remote
and created a pull request for DJ.  Then did the local merge back int
develop and deleted the fix-126 branch locally.  Then created the fix-115 branch
locally and copied in the CreateTable.cs which has the commented out
correction for the primary key seq_no.  After unaltered finishes and I write
down the timing, I'll correct, then build and run the create, acct load, Indexer,
then run the query engine again and time it.
Don't forget the RemotingServer.cs on the Desktop.  I'm removing the others.

---20190117 21:28:57
QueryEngine (aualtered - 19:24:15 - 19:08:04 = 16:11,
4 rules evaluated in 21.816 seconds.  37000 results.

---20190122 15:08:43
After resetting fix-117 to develop and copying back in the revised 
queryEngine and MaestroLite codes, I tested and committed fix-117 then
pushed and created the PR.  Testing now on erc-caml full MaestroLite.
Recovered the other approach from TimeCapsule of SplitState, TaskState,
and TestWaitState where it shows how to create ManualResetEvents,
do call backs and QueueUserWork Items to really do tasking.  This code
is stored in ~/Projects/CSharpSamples/statemachine/source.

---20190123 12:01:31
Mark briefing on meeting with Chris.  Understanding and still supportive.
Perception that we're making progress important.  We're owed money, and
some short term ways to deal with that.  Ten millions deal on the way,
every sign that's happening.  Some money left in ERC project, but need to
get delivery done so we can invoice.  Major factor in success is in
contacting the right person (RPC).  Model A shows that, if it had been
used, the model A, which was trained against June 2016(?) data and run
against their provided pilot data, would have resulted in getting the RPC
more that the present methods.  Area Under Curve (AUC) gives 70% higher value
BUT, it occurs in the wrong end of the graph.  The data has changed since
June 2016.  Model seems to be focusing on only a couple of the variables,
which some clients doen't actually provide.  Economy changed, gov't changed,
and that means retraining every few months.  Must get new data and retrain
for their primary client.  Call number is important and it needs to be 
captured and then utilized.  DJ, what is needed?  Clear set of questions.
Need the nightly call data with the intos ( call we will make, and last result).

---20190131 11:36:17
It appears that the modifications made today to the MonitorServerForData
in NotificationClient.cs reads the data correctly.  There remain two
problems with the code.  1) If the enter key is held down, then after
a bit, there will be a Broken Pipe exception caused by the tcp channel
being busy receiving data and not available for sending? and 2) When entering
data, the first character cannot be erased and replaced.  

I think the status now, is that it is good enough for testing  and I'll
now move to set up the controller its input comes from a web page that
shows the list of 'clients', with the status of each, and buttons by
each client for start, stop, restart, status, pause.  The actual
Maestro program will have each Process having a notification client
that it reports changes of status to the Controller, and responds to
commands from the Controller.

---20190131 15:57:28
It appears that refactorValidator branch contains the refactored BREValidator
so that it does not need a Main Program to work with Maestro, thus each
process like ValidatorProcess can be launched as a task and it will 
communicate via the NotificationListener/Server.  The Maestro proj
in refactorValidator appears to be pretty complete.  I need to merge
the changes in maestro into refactorValidator and merge develop into these
also.  Probably merge develop into maestor branch and test, then
merge that maestro branch into refactorValidator.

Noticed that my library program has 456 entries, yet I was getting problems 
trying to load over 100 rows from then csv file.  Perhaps it was not the
size, but some other problem.  Revisit this!

---20190131 16:12:36
MVC_Maestro at ~/Projects/erc-caml is supposed to be the start of the
Web interface that would include the NotificationClient 'Controller'
that each of the launched process would communicate with and the viewer
for the log file.  See previous entry above.

---20190226 16:26:05
branch maestro has NotificationServer and NotificationClient and also
MaestroMain which runs the Maestro code.  This needs to be tested and compared
to the develop branch which also has a Maestro version.  
Projects/ruby-training/maestro has a database version of Maestro
Process Monitoring web page that needs to have jQuery integrated.

---20190304 11:18:21
Found that it was bad data in the queue that was causing the js error.
After cleaning out the database table with truncate queueEntry; it
showed all of the drop downs and behavior.  sc_demo is not, however,
saving anything created to the queue causing further problems.

---20190305 15:18:11
Found disagreement about number of arguments in DataTables in tasklist.xsl and in queueList.xsl.
It seems that you must carefully have the same numbers of items
in the setups as in the xsl or other ways you are building the tables.
Had to remove RESULT_OBJ and one other to get to show.  Needs those
added back to have clicking on them work.  Added bugs to bug list.

---20190316 12:48:12
Got the DataTables javascript to work in my rails blog example.
Haven't been able to get the default route right yet.
Have created a fix-routes branch in github to work on this.
Factored out parts of the layout.  Want to put the latest branch/commitid into
the footer and clean up the layout.  Then add Comments and
create the item/detail page where I select an item from the list and
its' Comments appear below the table. You can add a comment, or cancel.

---20190410 16:13:23
Found geek scripts were not showing up after update to 10.14.4.
Recovered the ~/Library/Preferences/org.tynsoe.* from April 1 time capsule
Then the app and it's preference pane also.
But, the scripts could not be edited in the geek tool
So, put the org.tynsoe.geeklet.shell.plist into BBEdit and
reinstalled the Geek Tool latest version 3.3.1 and reentered
the woo-laptop, barsoom and xanadu scripts and the To Do script.
Need to reinstall the Reminder script, perhaps and the weather 
script.

rbenv install 2.3.1
ruby -v (it is 2.3.1)
gem install bundler
gem install rails
bundle install
rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
rails s ( and it works )
Then tested I could revert to before add the rails-devise-roles and then
back again to having it installed and working.

---20190429 10:14:26
In .liquidpromptrc set LP_BATTERY_ENABLE=0 to turn off the message
about the AC Battery for the VMWareFusion OS X VM.

---20190505 10:17:19
Downloaded VMWare Fusion, installed it on old laptop.  Got License
from app on woo-laptop.  Created full clone of Rails for OS X 10.10 on
woo-laptop in ~/Documents/VirtualMacines and then copied it to old
laptop.  When copy is done, start it, then check that it works and that
it is communicating with github.  Then delete clone on woo-laptop and make
note in StackOverflow.

reinstalled vim from brew and copied in a basic .vimrc to get things back
to a reasonable way of working.  This eliminates the R funcions, etc.

---20190521 13:58:33
The R version is in a tar file in ~/Projects, I believe for vimrc

---20190605 09:19:58
Installed NeoBundle into .vim and updated .vimrc to load it and the todo-vim plugin it installs with those settings.  This was on woo-old-laptop.
NOTE:  In rails # TODO add this or that, # FIXME method A is broken
and # OPTIMIZE improve the speed here.  These all work and can be found by
using rake notes, rake notes:todo, rake notes:fixme and rake notes:optimize

---20190614 11:22:47
Fixed time_track_report.pl to use -client, -mon, and -year.  Added the linkto old-mac-pro and got it working.

Used brew to install cloc.  It determines the language of files and counts loc and comments and summarizes.

---20190620 19:54:10
Created ~/bin/check-hosts.sh and ~/bin/check-server-status.sh.
Each of these checks the connection to a given host, viz. google.com, etc.
every SECONDS, ( default 360 or 5 minutes ).  It leaves the last result and emails if failure.
I should make it keep a running log by appending to that log.

Have worked up to setting up web-server and trying out the get, post examples.
Working from tutorial Node.js - Express Framework at: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_express_framework.htm
I installed:
npm install express --save
npm install body-parser --save
npm install cookie-parser --save
npm install multer --save

multer handles multipart form data, while body-parser and cookie-parser
should be obvious.

---20190917 12:01:17
Check that edits are conveyed between machines.

---20190917 12:02:06
It appears that edits on woo-laptop get viewed on va-air!

---20190917 12:45:36
Fixed bin/alias on woo-laptop so that it doesn't give is docker running error.
Had to comment out line in bin/alias that defined docker_clean as it
had an executable in it that was trying to be run when the command was made.

---20190917 12:50:49
Created DIARY as export to use everywhere.

Corrected American Express and Social Security Emails.

---20190921 16:08:50
Finally built a rails app called herokuapp that deployed to heroku
after a LOT of work.  Had to locate a Postgres app for mac and install it.
Then use the command line to add a role for 'woo' and password 'As Usual'
and then start the server from the app, then the herokuapp worked locally.
Then pushed to heroku using jwooten37830@mac.com and password in Wallet.
Need to review this again and understand the dependencies.  Way too complicated.
Many of these items are in Evernote.

---20190921 16:48:33
Corrected bad closing div in blog/app/views/layouts/_footer.html.erb
Then applied the footer div to herokuapp and tested locally.  It worked.
Then tried to deploy to heroku and found that it did not get applied.

---20190921 17:01:07
Added TODO geek_script to va_air.

Tested using test.txt and commands, teco, eb$$, sHello$0tt$$,ex$$

---20190924 21:26:59
Corrected geek_script for Disk Usage.  myDisk -> mDisk, plus
be sure that the proper /dev/disk1s1 is used.  May be different on others.

---20190925 09:55:27
Changed ~/bin/newmain_2.bash to hide cpu and disk but show top 3 cpu and disk
Only on va-air right now.

Updated newmain.bash to include check_psql.sh.  Add this to other machines

---20190925 11:24:12
Updated newmain.bash to include check_mongo.sh.  Use the brew that
installs mongo community edition instead of the cask version.

---20190926 11:35:32
Something screwed up with cvs on va-air.  Works on woo-laptop with local rep
but not using remote repostory on barsoom.  Can't find cvs on it?

---20190926 12:51:07
Problem with cvsstat was cvs was not in PATH on barsoom.  Added it.

---20190927 14:41:22
Got cvs working from woo-air by restarting barsoom!
Installed gitlab-runner on woo-laptop via brew install gitlab-runner.  Not sure what I
will do with it.
Continue to look at setting up github on barsoom as more stable.

---20190927 15:26:22
Finally got sudo working without password on woo-air!  
To get it I edited sudo visudo and added line %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

Edited time_track_report.pl to introduce -summary flag, but not tested
for data as no file present.

---20191011 16:27:16
Did a lot of fiddling with apachctl hiding the others/+*.conf which
was causing an error.  Plus messed with trying to get php working which
I did by relinking soft link to php5 for command line.  This means php7 
is being used for web, but php5 for command line.  After reloading OS 10.14
then be sure I'm running just the one php 7_ consistently.  check
rails, etc.

---20191018 16:42:16
Register, send email works via: https://jwooten37830.com/patti/email-confirm/register_and_confirm.php
Then it brings up  the confirmation from the link and saves confirmed
status in the database.  At this point we are ready to create
the EngageMoreCRM account, then direct them to ThriveCart.
The ThriveCart web-hook, at https://jwooten37830.com/patti/webhook/thrivecart.php will get the 
account message and print the output to response.txt.  it should have the
information to update the account and then send message for them to log in.

---20191018 16:48:50
This webhook was tested on barsoom.

---20191019 12:13:18
Found that keyboards/text/jw was inserting jwooten37839@mac.com!  Changed it!

---20191021 12:12:50
Changed Dropbox back to basic, removed all but Notes from my Drobbox.
All else that was in Dropbox is in va-air in Desktop/Shared.

Use command-option-R to do network recovery and install OS X Catalina
to replace the beta version I was using.  Still ended up with 2 mac HD on desktop which screws up the backups of woo-va-air.  Now doing a clone
of the Data portion of the APFS to "Backup" small drive.  Afterwards, will
erase the drive and do full new install, probably erase and try to clone 
from the clone on "Backup".  If that doesn't work, then erase drive, reinstall OS X Catalina, then transfer data from the clone. 

---20191029 15:51:54
Updated thrivecart.php on barsoom/patti/webhook to reject all but product 9, and add those to AllClients.  Second add of same email did not create
and error.  Investigate this, and send email to user and  insert note to patti
in AllClients with account info.

---20191104 18:09:57
As of 18:10, thrivecart.php creates an account in EngageMoreCRM in the proper group.
It is not being logged on barsoom in response.txt.
I need to add saving to database and keeping a log in database of requests.
Also in ruby from database, create tools to examine.
Then look at abandoned pages.

---20191105 09:50:13
It appears to be necessary to have dir and file permissions set to 777
in order for thrivecart.php to be able to write to webhooks directory.
With that change, the information is recorded into response.txt correctly.

---20191105 14:30:10
Got mysql_common.php working and integrated into thrivecart.php
Tested and it logged and inserted the xref.

---20191106 12:09:58
