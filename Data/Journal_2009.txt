Sent Mike Uzzle his key from Documents/Projects/AreteQ/Keys/Deep6_Keys.text

Found maven and tested it after setting up the exports in .bash_profile
MAVEN_HOME, M2 ( not used ), MAVEN_VERSION ( so I can change it ), etc.
It appears that /usr/local/apache-maven/$MAVEN_VERSION is where the code for maven is.
Also, under ~woo/.m2 is a repository where all of the jars, etc. used by my projects
can be kept.  They get updated each time I run, I think.  I’m going to get the documentation
for maven and print it out to study.  I want to find out about the metrics portion.

cd ~
  553  cd Development
  554  ls
  555  mkdir maven
  556  cd maven
  
  558  mvn archetype:create -DgroupId=com.shoulderscorp.wfeditor -DartifactId=wfeditor
  559  ls
  560  cd wfeditor
  561  ls
  562  mvn package

  564  java -cp target/wfeditor-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.shoulderscorp.wfeditor.App
  -> produces “Hello World!”
  
  3)  Looked up the JDepend plugin and inserted the xml into the pom.xml ( this could probably be
  in a site pom.xml for all to use ).
  The code inserted was:
  <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>jdepend-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      </plugin>

  Then typing mvn site:site in the directory where that pom.xml was creates a target/site/index.html
  which points to reports where cyclic dependencies, etc. show up.  I want to apply this to my
  sc_framework projects and to Q when I can.
  
  Here is a link to the report:  file:///Users/woo/Development/maven/wfeditor/target/site/index.html
  It appears that I need to define some other things like description, etc.
  Can the eclipse plugin help with that?  How to move an eclipse project(s) into
  the maven framework to be able to get a look at the JDepend output?
  
  2009-02-20
  
  1)  Installed Version: 3.4.1
Build id: M20080911-1700 into ~woo/Development/Applications/Eclipse3.4.1

  2)  Installed Mylyn and necessary dependencies (AJT)
  3)  Installed m2eclipse
  4)  Ran AVL and KWIC and they appear to work.
  5)  Not tested with older Q or Deep6 or sc_framework stuff.
  6)  Need to learn how to create the pom for maven from the eclipse files.
  7)  Managed to get the pom created for btree and also saved to svn.
  8)  Inserted the JDepends part into the pom and emailed Robert the report for btree.
  
 
  9)  Need to continue to create poms for the Deep6 projects and then a master pom
  	in the Deep6 itself to build the entire jar file. 
  10) Then add the reports part.  I need to figure out where to put the super pom with
  	that in it. ***TODO***

 	1)  iPhone products:
 		a)  Native American Visualizer - shows on Google Map native american tribes locations
 			versus time and allows showing alliances, and enemies.  Has search.
 		b)  Relativity Calculator: - allows calculation of time and space dilations,
 				mass - energy relations, etc.
 		c)  RLC calculator: Shows RC time constants, RLC resonances, Q, etc.
 		d)  Lens calculator: - shows focal point for lenses and combinations.
 		e)  Transforms calculator: - shows Fourier, Bessel, and other transforms, high and low
 			and band pass filters.
 		f)  ODDBALL - create forth like ODDBALL calculator allowing use of vectors
 				just like oddball with graphics!
 		g)  Lister: - shows lists of lists by category like N-1 list ( Dwarves, Planets,
 			Reindeer, Norse Gods (their children ), Religions, States along with
 			short comment on each.  This one would use a SQLLite database to be expandable.  Searchable.
 			Joint Children to Items like children of gods to gods, with type=CHILDREN, and 
 			parent=ODIN.  Can also download new categories or updates.
 		h)  CIVIL War Visualizer: battles, maps, etc. Show campaigns, details of Gettysburg.
 		i)  WWI, WWII, other famous battles.
 		j)  FORTH on iPhone?
 		k)  Fortune on iPhone?  i.e. random quote for fortune cookie on UNIX.  Shake to get another.
 		l)  BS Bingo, people within Bluetooth or WiFi can play BS Bingo, select a category of
 			speaker and select new to get a Bingo board.  Bingo shows up on all with winners name.
 			
 		
 	2)  Look at these directories to see how to reduce size.

		Thinking of moving Backups, PC_Share, and Downloads to 1/2 terabyte drive.
		Would free up about 6 gig.
		May move some of Development also, since it is 11 Gig total.
		

---20090222

	1)  Moved a lot of Backups and Downloads older stuff to my .5 Gig firewire drive.
	2)  Copied Development there just as another backup.  Might think about removing some of
		the older applications and folders from the internal drive to regain some space.
	3)  Copied the Backups and Download from the fireware to the USB-02 as another backup.
	4)  Freed up about 3 Gig on m internal.
	5)  Looking into using the maven internal repository for all my downloaded jars,
		instead of having multiple 3rdParty jars in almost every workspace.  Might be
		able to easily do it with links to the maven repository for now.
	6)  Read and learn the maven2 stuff and see if I can set up the Deep6 builds so that
		it has a profile for Vista and my Mac that work!
	

---20090223

	1)  Installed JBoss Portal and tested.  It appears to work.
	2)  Located preliminary work on drag at: file:///Users/woo/Development/OlderSoftware/ECP/ecp_workspace/javascript/webApplication/Domapi/examples/drag.htm
	3)  Can’t find my old archives (tarfiles?).  There should be a project
		from ECP with DragAndRelate
		

---20090224

	1)  Copied sc_app from Tomcat 4 to JBoss 4.2.2 AS - gets perm gen error
	2)  Copied jbossws.sar over to 4.2.2 but failed also.
		Question of how to have sc_app, pcpi, and portal all under 4.2.2 GA? ***TODO***

	8)  Lyrics to Dan Fogelbergs “Auld Ang Syne”
Met my old lover in the grocery store
The snow was falling christmas eve
I stole behind her in the frozen foods
And I touched her on the sleeve

She didnt recognize the face at first
But then her eyes flew open wide
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse
And we laughed until we cried.

We took her groceries to the checkout stand
The food was totalled up and bagged
We stood there lost in our embarrassment
As the conversation dragged.

We went to have ourselves a drink or two
But couldnt find an open bar
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store
And we drank it in her car.

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how.

She said shed married her an architect
Who kept her warm and safe and dry
She would have liked to say she loved the man
But she didnt like to lie.

I said the years had been a friend to her
And that her eyes were still as blue
But in those eyes I wasnt sure if I saw
Doubt or gratitude.

She said she saw me in the record stores
And that I must be doing well
I said the audience was heavenly
But the traveling was hell.

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how.

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to time
Reliving in our eloquence
Another auld lang syne...

The beer was empty and our tongues were tired
And running out of things to say
She gave a kiss to me as I got out
And I watched her drive away.

Just for a moment I was back at school
And felt that old familiar pain
And as I turned to make my way back home
The snow turned into rain --

Lyrics to Elton Johns “some day out of the blue”
Some day out of the blue
In a crowded street or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Some day we can start again, some day soon

Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
The sweet afternoons
Still capture me

Some day out of the blue
In a crowded street or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Some day we can start again, some day soon

I still believe
I still put faith in us
We had it all and watched it slip away
Where are we now
Not where we want to be
Those hot afternoons
Still follow me

Some day out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Some day we would live again, some day soon

I still believe
I still put faith in us

I still believe
I still put faith in us

I still believe
I still put faith in us

Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
The sweet afternoons
Still capture me

Some day out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Some day we would live again, some day soon

Some day out of the blue
In a crowded street or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Some day we can start again, some day soon

I still believe
I still put faith in us

I still believe
I still put faith in us

I still believe
I still put faith in us

(Fade)
I still believe
I still put faith in us

Add to presentation on Tuesday:


ClearHealth - what I understand.  Need more due diligence.

TecSec's data encryption and eCard system.  Game changer for health records.  Need to have briefing for you.

Wave from Google, another game changer in that communication is put into a new light.  Need to research more.  We have been looking at how it could change things.

Put some of the images for estimator and other things into folders with the projects in case someone else wants a copy.

Look up 3DMatrix Code, BOINC, Folding@home, Goldfish, Marine Aquarium 2.0 for new versions for screensavers.

Found problem with Parallels wp.1 Tomcat pcpi.  I needed to relabel so that there was a drive D: with some stuff
	Now, something is looking on E:  I think I cause that editing somewhere.  Will have to

	E: instead of either C: or D:  
	Login to &PI/SuperUser/adpadp.  For some reason, su is locked.  Will have to fix.
	Can’t bring up employee list, etc.  Check the connection, etc.
	
Look at sc_app and fill in holes in maint, filtering by company, etc.
Work on refactor to get rid of the data_manipulation and also make queue loosely coupled
	to the state machine via a notification.  Get rid of the complicated thread hash.

Purchase upgrade for Parallels so I can build
Deep6!

mysql database changed to have password on root.
This causes lots of sc_app and other failures.
Where is the password kept?
(make this a parameter in the apps?)
(Temporarily changed password back to blank.  This fixed sc_app).  

Need to fix the filtering on the task list and other queries to include the organization!

Note that when clicking on a Job it shows the job history.  Make it so the entry of older items can be
shown when they are clicked on in the Job history pane.  This allows showing the data, the person, and more details about that entry.

			Do some stuff for the FHCC.
			Original scope for contract can’t be modified, talk about a BRD and use cases.
			Always been allowed lattitude, for some reason contract officer will not deviate.  Jeff Sartori wants to complain because we want to
				do something.  No more Rosendale or Donham said do this.  Technicality.
				Wrote task order 6 to keep us on contract.
				Doug argues that discovery is a part and relevant.  Very congruent with what is needed, i.e. BRD and use cases.
			Use cases: problem today - laboratory orders in amorphous cloud and hanging.

	Each group has it's own login handler, but uses a service for authentication.
Personnel Class library has common functionality and controls that all in "solution" share or extend.

Most use stored procedures. MEDPROS does not use stored procedures.  WebDataEntry rewriting in .Net.  AdHoc queries don't use either.

MEDPROS: WebReporting(32), WebDataEntry(35)
AD...HRSolution(XWebReporting) 366.9, 366.10, 366.16, 366.23, are being replaced by a new combined reporting module in .net 3.5 (MVC).  Entity Framework version 1.

Don't have regression tests for lower level data and business object access.
Difficult to foster reuse since library is fairly large and not completely documented.  There are templates for new apps.

Authentication provides a centralized authentication but not authorization for particular roles or functions within apps.  Thus each app handles authorization itself.  No LDAP, uses database and permissions and each app sets and uses its own permissions.

One database on one instance for Human Resources. Total databases about 20's.  

Business Rules are implemented in Stored Procedures.  Moving to more centralized, but not a rules engine.

No externally facing web services in HR system.  Hoping to produce web services to publish pay information for soldiers.

AKO WebServices:  Authentication and Medical Readiness, no schema,  feeds AKO and MEDPROS "black page".  Uses stored procedures to pull data for status translation and business logic.  Database determines status using stored procedures.  
Suicide Prevention Task Force is service based and outward facing.

What is way to aggregate data across apps.  Each app has its own data tables usually and don't share between apps.  DOORs, UIC, force structure from US Army down to units.  Central personnel database.

Error handling separate for each "suite".  No centralized error handling.  Each app defines exception handling policy.  Green screen access to MEDPROS on mainframe and mirrors what is available through web.  One app has no web equivalency.  Fairly large group of users using main frame.  Main frame is enterprise data store.  Work on web apps goes into app data bases with batch xfer back to mainframe.  MEDPROS is largest footprint on mainframe.  Last date element overwrites older date if "simultaneous" from web and from mainframe.

Downloaded medical (uses openERP) and told Doug, Tom, and Jack Taylor about it.  Written in Python.  Mac has 2.5 installed.  Terminal, type python!
Downloaded openERP to see if I could get anything working.  Can’t connect to database (?) no instructions on how to create database AND it’s in French!
Let note.  Will check later ***TODO***

Bob Haas, Alex Z., Tom Love, Zack, about Capri and info on creating reports and what mechanisms, etc.
	a)  Look for copy/paste 
	b)  Zack - 57 exam reports ( 58 ), Examination protocols.  Disability ratings
		Audio
		Joints
		Stomach 
		...
		These are exam templates 
		Reports are data from a computer system.
		Providers dictate into blank form, transcribe into system
		Provider uses Capri template, fills in and populates form and gets structured.
		Take coded structure and format so it’s easy to read.  Formatting currently is just like flow of information in Capri template.
		Based on how provider conducts exam.  Report is for VBA rating specialist, change so specialist can read and understand better.
			put in logic so perhaps might filter so they see only a limited amount that might be pertinent ( hide those not pertinent ).
		Gather requirements as to how they use data.
		Only use ASCII, upper and lower, with Title in upper case, response in mixed case.  Can use tabs, underlines, dashes, asterisks, but little else.
		Software we’ll get will allow building templates.  This is in Delphi.  Can be used standalone and is also integrated into Capri.
		Regional office uses VistA to print.
		Examiner uses Capri to fill in template, then they end up in VistA as a part of Amy.
		Regional Office uses CPRS/VistA to pull that copy out for patients to be examined and prints it.  Prints out of Amy(in Vista where stored).  View on screen using Capri.
		Print could be in pdf form.
		
		Provider knows condition being looked at.  Desired that questions about condition cause backend of data capture format the report into
		the form desired for output.  That means before being stored into Amy, a database in VistA system, the data stream can be transformed from the form used
		by the provider into the form desired for use by the examiner or reviewer.  For a joint problem, move the relevant data to the front of the report
		and the rest below as desired.

Remains to count comments, etc.  Adapt code metrics to see if I can could same?

Downloaded devMetrics20.msi to be installed as a plugin into the Visual Studio IDE and used for metrics of .net apps.  ***TODO***


---20091003

	1)  Updated VMWare Fusion.
	2)  Updated Windows XP, PCPI(where I want to try PCPI), C# (where I put the dev.msi thingy for metrics in C#), and JBoss
	3)  password for jwooten is password.
	4)  C# seems to think .Net and IDE are not installed.  Need to resolve that and then install devMetrics.msi ***TODO***
