	1)  Copied CSHARP.vmwarevm to sjacobso@gmail.com's DropBox VMWARE.
		Installed DropBox ( much like MobileMe, only for others )
		Moved DropBox install location to my external drive so I'd
		have space for CSHARP�
	2)  Created a bitbucket account woo37830 (jwooten@shoulderscorp.com)
		and created a private repository called CAPRI.  Haven't figured
		out how to get sjacobso invited as a member yet.


---20100106

	1)  Created a bitbucket (Mercurial) repository Capri - downloaded Mecurial for Mac and added it.
		a)  In Documents/Projects/VeteransAdministration/Capri created
			a directory capri and cd'd into it.
		b)  created a ~/.hgrc with [ui]
					username=John Wooten <jwooten@shoulderscorp.com>
			in it.
		c)  Did an add for 3 source files then committed, then pushed.
		d)  Showed up in bitbucket.
		e)  Added seth(sethjjacobson) as a reader and writer, asked him to check it.

	2)  Need to create Deep6 jar and Deep6.bat for Robert and Charles and put on

Got the traitlist showing its values in the table.  (Note that there might be two places where traitlist.xml is stored).
Need to fix the page for Review Traits so that instead of the id showing on the left, a check box shows to select for the person.
	***DONE*** Now the addMops will also add the selected to the person as traits!
Add a person at the beginning of the New Employee, etc.
Select the traits to apply, those then are added as children of the person, i.e. a list of traits to be applied for evaluation.
Do the same for creating Mops.
Make the creating and editing of a Trait work.  Should mean adding a saveInstance, getInstance, updateInstance action.
The home page for SystemAdmin is wrong.  Tasklist isn't right there.
Created a zip file of sc_workspace as was unable to check in due to
	branch problems.  How to resolve?


---20100413

Created environment.plist as follows
	in terminal window do:
	> cd ~
	> mkdir .MacOSX
	> echo "" > .MacOSX/environment.plist
	> open .MacOSX/environment.plist

	Then added TOMCAT_HOME as the path to it.
	when logged back in, in terminal window >env shows the TOMCAT_HOME
	is set.  This can be used for other environment variables also!

Sent the sc_app.zip and sql and sc_workspace.zip to public iDisk, informed
	Seth
Create a VM with mysql, etc. already installed and Eclipse and test then
	distribute.

Password for linux jwooten on VMFusion is password. Changed to random1
Passwprd for root on VMFusion appears to be password.
In terminal window did su -s and after entering 'password' ended up a root
	then did visudo and added line at end jwooten = ALL(ALL)  ALL
	did ^ZZ and got out.  Now jwooten is in list of suddoers.
Tested that mysql can be started then.
in terminal window do:
	> su -
	> enter 'password' password for root
	> cd /usr/local/mysql NOT TO BIN DIRECTORY FOR SOME REASON
	> /bin/mysqld_safe & to start daemon
	> exit to get back to non root user
To start jboss, in terminal window do jb start, (jb stop, to stop)
	enter simgod's password of simgod.
I entered TOMCAT_HOME into .bash_profile and it's available when logged in.
sc_app doesn't start yet, may need to create war and drop into deploy.
	seam-booking works, but step_2 doesn't.
created some vm snapshots.

Downloaded archived tomcat 4.1.31 and installed in sc_app vm.
moved sc_app into tomcat.  Problems with aim.properties.
	a)  edited DBProperties and added attempt to get via classResourceLoader.
		appeared to work.
	b)  having problems with sun.jdbc.odbc driver.  Appears to be there
		via test.
	c)  Having problems that TOMCAT_HOME seems to refer to older home.
		haven't logged out and back in so trying that.
Had to install mysql connector, BUT couldn't figure out how to get odbc
	connection set up as couldn't locate where driver class was.
Added to DBUtility for queue and for entity to use jdbc connection
	where database is specifically given instead of indirectly.
	i.e. jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/queue_db something like that.
	driver class is jdbc.mysql.Driver or such.

	Need to clean these up to come from either environment! OR FROM CONFIG.
GOT THE sc_app to show up login, and login.  Did new hire and
	it showed jsp, but didn't queue it perhaps.

	***TODO*** Test queueing etc. to be sure all is working.  Got stack
	overflow, but that could be Linux.  Will add a eclipse parm in the
	test settup. for stack and heap.

Found error in new hire in that it depended upon Person entity being already
	created.  Added conditionallyCreatePersonEntity and it worked!
	Not working in sc_app however.

Work on the tests and change password and send to seth.

Downloaded Jaxer into Applications/Aptana_Jaxer, but it doesn't work.
	I need to:

	Mac OS X: On this platform mod_jaxer is compiled as a 32 bit executable. If you are running a 64-bit Apache you need to recompile mod_jaxer to 64 bit mode, then copy the resulting .so file into /Applications/Aptana_Jaxer/jaxer/connectors.
Grab the Jaxer Connectors source code first!
Switch to mod_jaxer folder in exploded source:
	cd ~/Downloads/1.0.0.4310/products/server/src/connectors/apache/apache-modules/mod_jaxer
Compile: /usr/sbin/apxs -Wc,-arch -Wc,ppc64 -Wl,-arch -Wl,ppc64 -c -Wc,-arch -Wc,x86_64 -Wl,-arch -Wl,x86_64 -c -o mod_jaxer.so *.c
Copy: cp .libs/mod_jaxer.so /Applications/Aptana_Jaxer/jaxer/connectors
Restart Apache: sudo apachectl graceful

-Got Jaxer working by copying libsqlite3.dylib from /usr/lib into jaxer to
	replace the one there.  Got this from a forum about getting jaxer to run
	on Snow Leopard.

	***TODO*** Figure out how to use Jaxer to improve sc_app, etc.

- Downloaded WordService and placed it into ~woo/Library/Services
	then in services preferences turned on several of them.  Now in TextEdit
	and other editors I can insert the date, time, etc.

- Got sc_app into Eclipse as project.  Found preferences.jsp references metrics_db.  ***TODO*** find sql for that and move to Linux and
create database, retest.  Apparently no such sql.  Adapt preferences by adding fields mentioned in preferences.jsp.

Found that the tables generated by the scripts have lower case names, but
	the sql statements often have upper case table names.
a parameter lower-case-table-names=1 should make it work BUT can't find how
	to get that input, either in command line or /etc/my.cnf
Can't get the mysql to even start now. going to stop linux and start
	over tomorrow.  May edit all of my sql commands to match case?

Linux stuff not working, but appears to be based upon bad actionLibraries,
	missing actions, etc.
	a)  Look at TraitsActionLibrary.  Missing SaveInstance, and RemoveInstance.
	b)  Test these locally, BUT rename all upper case table names to lc.
	c)  Get a good set of tests working, then move to linux again.
	Seem to have sources fixed, etc.

Need to get the gem that covers logging and work with it a bit.
Fixed lots of startup problems with application.  It needed work to get

Created exe file for Mike Uzzle and put on public.  It seems to work fine for me.  Robert needs to clean up logging when writing out the redacted file.  It looks like it is sending a copy of what it writes to the console!
***TODO*** Get the login gem.
***TODO*** Figure out how to store small images for redaction.
Is there a way to create an image with words in it?  I.e. create a jpeg

Helped get Robert started on showing black rectangles where they should be.
Downloaded glassfish and followed instructions to install

Then did chmod on lib files as per
Then did a run of setup.sh ( i think )
Then cd to bin directory
type asadmin start-domain domain1
Lots of playing around to get testtag with example.jsp to work, but it did.
	had to have servlet context root say testtag.
SO, now I can experiment with tag library and using EL expression language
See if I can convert some things over to this.
Have to use netbeans so that I can deploy easily?


---20100528  8:24:21 AM

Did backup
Edited my prompt and added the current working directory ( a bit long at times )  ***NOTE*** this is in .bash_profile  it sources bin/.alias, bin/supercd, etc.
discovered I had changed cd to supercd, means keeps history.
	use cd X to move to X, mcd to see menu of them, cd to move to home
***TODO***
	1)  add gfu and gfd to .alias so I can start and stop glassfish
	2)  add sc_app to netbeans and see if it makes developing sce: table
		tag easier.
		<sce:table id="x" src="session[tasklist]" � >
			<sce:column label="LABEL1" path="queueEntry">
				<sce:link action="" destination="dest-state"/>
			</sce:column>
			<sce:column label="LABEL2" path="stateName"/>
		</sce:table>
	will be just like <sc:table> except use bean path (or expeditor) to
		get to value etc.  It will apply "getQueueEntry" to
		the item in the list.
	3)  Make sure behavior of application is consistent.  Fix broken.
	4)  Make login screen look better. Add to style sheet.
	5)  As sce tags replace sc tags, dependency on datamanipulation decreases.
	6)  put session, page(for request), job, application, global as scopes
		but they are always provided as a part of
		the input data as parameters.  session[tasklist:list]
		i.e. syntax is optional scope(session assummed)[name of item:type of item]  types are list, string, number, date, vector, map(key must be furnished) etc.
	7)  Look into a single signon or authentication ability.
	8)  change to use mysql user database.  Contains
		username:string
		email:string
		person:link to person table
		password_salt:string
		password_hash:string
		last_login:timestamp

		create user_db, user_db_test, user_db_development
		do same for queue_db.

		in configuration tell if development, production, or test.
		move all db.cfg to same place

		db.cfg
		[user_db]

Things to do for Deep6/IAR
   Here is what we have found today.   Everything below refers to text mode.
   The Redaction Reason options did not all have User as a default selection,  I FIXED THAT AND COMMITTED THEM.
   "TXT" files should be opened that same way "txt" files are. ***DONE***
   The hit counter is not modified when the user selects or deselects a hit. ***DONE*** (caveat, for text, pdf hit count isn't for blue boxes, but "hits")
If you select some unhighlighted text, the Redaction Reason pops up;  If you choose Cancel the text becomes blue anyway. ***TODO*** (Robert working)
   To close the Comment Panel you have to click on Close twice. ***DONE*** (could not reproduce. Changed so it hides when scanning starts)
Robert

***TODO*** Look for Encrypt for java like Rails.
	Store salt and then hash password.  When read in password,
	take salt, hash and compare.  No stored password only hash

***TODO*** Remove logging statements from PdfDocumentWriter to get rid of
	dings to terminal

Fixed problems that Charles reported on selecting not working, - exception
	being caused by concurrent modification.  Can't remove an item from a list that an iterator is iterating through
	failure to hard save file with image redaction - null ptr caused by logger statement using the un-set token if not PdfWord
	numerous repaints of screen ( the HitTokens ) - added refreshingTokens
	PreferencePanel was too large on some machines.  Added saving dimension
	and used scrollers for inner panels.

***TODO***
	a)  Review disk of IP and make notes
	b)  Back to work on sc_app.  Clean up where databases get their info
		from.  Make consistent.  They all use the config file!
		How to communicate that to the "archivers".

	c)  Check out some more rails stuff.
	d)  Work on authentication for java.  Where do I find the
		encryption code so I can use salt and hash?


---20100601  1:25:45 PM

***TODO***
	a)  sc_workspace needs to have QueueDataBase, which is working
		for reading and writing, used as an Archiver so that
		the rest of the code can work, like isComplete method.
		Problem is how to create the archiver so that the
		QueueDataBase gets it's database properties set.
	b)  In DBTest, I commented out the two places about Entities as
		that is also waiting on becoming an Archiver.
	c)  Do the catch inside PdfDocumentWriter to warn when
		a file is in use.
	d)  Cleaned up and improved my assembleProduct.sh script.
		i)  Added a version.dat with the version like "3_24"
			in it.
		ii)  The assembleProduct.sh now reads in the version,
			displays it and prompts for new version.
			It then writes out the version for next time.
			It internally creates the date stamp for the buildstr
		iii)  I create the application.ini IN THE SCRIPT, so
			if we change, I need to change it there.  Perhaps
			I should have one I check in that has the stuff
			and it is maintained in the project.

Found that the test case for read instance attributes will succeed if
	it runs alone, but fails if it follows the readInstances.  Somehow
	there is interference or a difference.  Will step through one that fails
	to see what is happening when it follows another.

Key Field for entry is failing.  Have to fix.  In Entity Test.
Handling of the expression seems hard in general.  How do I create the
	expressible to know what table to use etc.
	select entity = Person from Attributes where ssn = xyz
	note that it isn't a simple query.  BUT, if I can get the front part
	so that it gets the instances of Person, then can run it through the
	evaluator ( and the evaluator can handle x.getValue(Y), rather than
	getY() ), it will work.  Will have to modify the evaluator to try
	getValue("Y") if getY() doesn't work.

Saved all old jars from time capsule to My_Passport/Data/jars with .ini files and other necessary to run them.
After testing and determining that 0522 seemed the best place to start,
	I recovered 0522 from SVN of main stream /redaction
Tested and it appears to not be flaky.
It is version 3_12.
Created new repository location Deep6/Development/3_12 and saved it there.
Deleted all on local and connected back to Deep6/Working/3_25 as it is
	what we're working to replace Production/3_25.
Recovered and beginning to remove HitToken to see if that is the problem.
The revision (HEAD) when recovered was 2312 revision number.
Checked in working version and tagged it 3_27_100608.  Drag works and
	so does Select / de-select without flaky behavior, but no linking of
	hit words.  Cursor gets handled and progress shows when re-loading KB.
Switch back to sc_workspace

---20100613  8:27:38 AM

Think about how to have a grammar so that I can provide:
	a)  The type of argument, e.g. String or List
	b)  The name of the argument, e.g. userId
	c)  The path of the argument, e.g. $SESSION or [position() = $elementIndex]/objectIdentifier
	d)  The context of the argument, e.g. tasklist as it this variable
		is obtained from the "tasklist" item in the environment.
		If it has an index, i.e. $INDEX, then the context is a List.
	e)  The label to be used for the item.  e.g. "User"

	We have so far name[path].methodName[value]�
	So for a queueEntry list in env as "tasklist", we could
	provide
		queueEntry[String,$INDEX,tasklist[List,$SESSION]].entryNumber[String]
	and userId would be accessed by
		userId[String,$USER]

	So we have

		name[type,path,context,label].name[type,path,context,label]�

	Get zipCode from Person who has address.  A person is currently
		in session with name _person and is an Entity "Person"

	env.getAttribute("_person[Instance,$SESSION].value[Instance,addr].value[String,zipCode,,Zip Code]");

	This should locate the _person attribute in Scope.SESSION,
	cast it to a Instance(if needed), the do a getValue("addr") from the
	instance, which will be another Instance, then getValue("zipCode")
	from the obtained "address" and if needed the label will be "Zip Code".

Is it possible to define a set of variables for an application right in the xml for the application, and also for a statemodel right in the xml.

	i.e.

organization Shoulders (organization.xml)
	<uses>
		<element>
			<name>userId</name>
			<type>String</type>
			<path>$USER</path>
		</element>
		�
		<element>
			<name>tasklist</name>
			<type>List</type>
			<path>$SESSION</path>
			<action>GetTasklistAction</action>  ???
		</element>
		<element>
			<name>queueEntry</name>
			<type>String</type>
			<path>tasklist[String,$INDEX  ??? more compressed or like this?  Perhaps use existing dm, but from differently organized files?
	</uses>
	Application HR (hr.xml)
		<uses>
			<element>

			</element>
		</uses>
	Process

So we have data-dictionaries at each level, rule.xml at each level.  We don't look all over the place for things, but always in the same place
	$HOME/organizations/ORGANIZATION , get organization.xml and rules.xml
		/APPLICATION, get application.xml, rules.xml
			/PROCESS, get process.xml, rules.xml

Ran reasonably successful test of login and dispatcher.
Screwed up rest of tests they are getting ./organizations
	I need to check and make default $TOMCAT_HOME instead of .



---20100616  9:47:35 AM

Fixed TestRegulator.  It wasn't getting right config file and path.
	Secret to regulators is to load them ( should happend during
	initialization ), then add event listeners.  For instance, in
	the password validation, we should fire an loginEvent.  The
	regulator listens to the event, fires the proper rules, and then
	either throws and exception or not.  If an exception, it is caught
	and used to return the reason to the user.  Thus the rules for
	logging in are in the RegulatorRules.xml instead of the code.
	***TODO*** integrate this into ServletLoginContainer.

Why do I have a ThreadHash?  If all info is in the Environment and that is
	in the session?  Is it because the archivers, etc. need info?  Must be.
	It seems like application data should be in a scope that is shared by
	the applications.  No state data, that goes in session.  Process
	models and statemachines go in process scope.  The momento goes in the
	users state.
	***TODO*** clean this up!  Advance should be more about
	getting the statemachine, getting the users momento, setting it,
	advancing, storing the momento, etc.  Role based behavior might be
	handled by the regulator?  Apply rules there.  are we firing events
	when we start advance, start action, finish action, finish advance?

Got task list showing.  I was putting "organization" as the creating organization instead of env.getAttribute(Scope.USER, "organization").  No

History does not show anything.  Suspect how items are obtained.
Statistics shows number of entries, etc. but no statistics on them.
	Suspect how they are obtained.  See a lot of datamanipulation.  perhaps in servletStateMachine container where it is doing history.

add instance is getting string array also.

delete link threw exception with no message?

p47 line 20 - p48 line 6.  Don't those say exactly the same thing in different words?

p48 line 11 where he states java released in 1995,
JDK 1.0 (January 23, 1996) called Oak originally  (small point, it was probably out somewhere as 0.9 and called Oak)

getScheduledTime is not returning the correct time.  Returns 0 when should be 8, for instance. ***DONE*** found error in using arrays changed to dicts
The userName, day, date don't get filled in on the InputController.  ***DONE*** have to set strings then put in labels in viewDidLoad
Need to provide the real day schedule on setEntries for InputController.
***DONE*** but not filling in yet.
Possible still bug when do next prev too many times?  Used to happen
	when went from Tues to Wed where there was no Wed day.
Shouldn't be able to close a non-scheduled day!

Array with each entry is a dictionary whose key is the day date '11/15/2010'
	and internally has an array by TCODE e.g. 01, 11, 13.
	Each entry has Tcode, subcenter code, no of hours, sub total
	last entry has empty tcode, subcenter code, Total, total hours.

	Note there can be more than one subcenter code for the TCode.

Got work done on AVL Tree
Working with BufferedAVLTree.
	a)  The testProbe method is important.
	We should be sure that after probing for "BBB", then "AAA" that
	there is just two nodes in the buffer and that the left node of
	BBB is AAA and the right node of AAA is BBB and that's all.
	b)  It appears that the left node of BBB is being set correctly,
		but the right node of AAA is not being set at all.  Both
		must be set.  I think when it finds the node not set
		it adds it again.  Thus the duplicate AAA in the buffer.
	Balancing is turned off until we can create a tree without balancing
	that is correct.
