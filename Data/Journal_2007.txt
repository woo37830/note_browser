	1)  Use:
		com.mysql.jdbc.Driver as the driver class in the config file
			driverClass for pcpi.
	2)  Need to remap objects -> relational using Hibernate to get rid of
		TopLink in pcpi.
	3)  Look up forth displa and add it as screens plus an editor for forth.
	

---20070108

	1)  Determined again that ShouldersPortable (AirPort) network 
		signin is 128 bit ASCII and value is 20202.
		
	2)	Progress in getting pcpi running in Windows under Mac.
		a)  Added advworks odbc connector.
		b)  Added taxdb odbc connector.
		c)  Created a D: drive under parallels
		d)  Learned about Shift-Control click for right click.
		e)  copied over the webapplication folder from Development/pcpi-deployed.
			apparently the top piece of the pcpi colored part is inline, BUT
			the bottom piece is in Development/web-applications?
		f)  The logo doesn't show up under the pcpi application ( probably a skin server thing)
		g)  Get error when trying to run quickcalc.  Not sure why yet.
		h)  Added a new hire sucessfully.
		i)  Haven't checked many things, but will begin.
		j)  Self Service not working, haven't added benefits, etc.
		k)  Haven't tried to go over to using mySQL yet.
		l)  Not seeing any queued items.  How to add one or why not seeing them?
			I don't think queuedb is separate is it?
		

---20070109

	1)  Created new Starbucks name and passwd.
			woo37830/random1
			
	2)  Ran pcpi in windows.  Fixed the SkinServer.jsp?  Need to add button
		to access the way we change the user profile.  CompanyInformation.jsp
		doesn't have that button.  Uses advworks from d:/Development/Projects/pcpi/conf.
	3)  Would really like to start over, by building a "loader" that builds up the
to build the processes.
		Slowly add the database tables and connections to get and put information that is
		needed to be stored.  Use the SOA approach.  When I need data get it via a service
		or save via a service.  Many of the services would be CRUD for various tables.
		a)  Start with define a person who has roles of employee, and user.  Thus, we
			have an actor that is a link joining the person to the role.  Does the general
			role such as employee or user have a list of behaviors?  When someone logs in,
			I ask the roles for the role 'user'.  From it, I get the name of the implementing
			class User.  Classes have a flag that tells me if it is a persistent class, I.e. it implements
			the persistent interface.  I can then use the name of the class to look up
			the service name for CRUD operations.
			
			<roles>
				<role name='user' />
				<role name='employee' />
				<role name='su' />
				...
			</roles>
			<services>  // create Service that reads these in and makes them available.
				<service name='addPerson(1,2,3,4,5)' sql='create PERSON with (lastName, firstName, 
					emailAddress, phomeNumer, phoneType ) using (%1, %2, %3, %4, %5 )' />
				<service name='addRole(1)' sql='create ROLE with (roleName) using (%1)' />
				<service name='addActor(1,2)' sql='create ACTOR with (roleName, 
					role, className) using (%1.as.%2, %1, %2) />
				<service name='addUser(1,2,3)' sql='create USER with (userID,password,personID) 
					using (%1,%2,%3 ) />
				<service name='validateUser(1,2)' class='Validate' method='user'
					args=(%1,%2) />  // calls Validate.user(%1,%2) returns true or false
				<service name='getPersonWithUserID(1)' sql='select User.personID PERSON.lastName, PERSON.firstName,
					PERSON.emailAddress, PERSON.phoneNumber, PERSON.phoneType from USER join PERSON using personID' />
				...
			</services> // read into client/servlet to define calls.
			

---20070111

	1)  Go to the access database and get the list of processes built into pcpi
	2)  Create a new workspace that is pcpi-bpm
	3)  Create those business processes, including early creating a default page
but has the top branding, and uses AJAX where
		possible for updating current worker, etc.
	4)  So, when a process is started like EmployeePersonalData, that process just
		loops on itself until it is terminated by starting another process.
		The process id is kept in session as current_process and if there when starting a
		new process, the current_process is terminated, i.e. marked complete and the transition
		is made to its end state.  The new process then becomes the current_process.
		There is also a current_selected_employee and that is the data that is displayed
		if the process is an "employee_process".  Clicking on an employee in the list
		of employees, makes that employee the "current_selected_employee".
	5)  To test this, create a process to addEmployees.  This fills out some Personal data
		(lastname, firstname, payid, ssn, email, phone, phone_type).  This will be maintained via the
		transition from "Add", where the action will be to add the employee object
		to an employees list in session, and wait for another add or Done.
	6)  Start the Processes/Employee/PersonalData process.  We should see
		the PersonalData.jsp with the list of employees down the left, fields filled in
		with the current_selected_employee, which will be the first one if null.
	6)  The next/prev buttons should select change the current_selected_employee and
		cause the page refresh.  Clicking on an employee should do the same.
	7)  Create the EmployeeList.jsp to handle this list.  If the List is null in
		session, bring up popUp list to enter a fileName to load employees from and 
		load them in.
		

---20070114

	1)  write a database script to select all in the business process table and dump it to a file.
		the menupaths to a file.  ***DONE*** using export to Excel and then exported to .csv
		In the jsp, check if xmlmenu and tabs are in session.  If not, then read in file
		using data from config.  Possibly use parts of the Navigator.java and the PayExpertMenu.java
	2)  Work on the tree and tabs.  See ~woo/Documents/Reference/xml_asl.webarchive?
	

---20070116

	1)  Session not being cleared on logout.  Also clear it on login!
	2)  Need to copy from CompanyInformation.java the stuff about the news months, etc.
		Also may have hints about tabs
	3)  Need to figure out how to do the xml when it is in a string rather than a file. ***DONE***
	4)  Support center stuff comes from CompanyInformation.java also.
	5)  Integrate a test case of a process and getting the queue list from JBossBPM.
	

---20070117

	1)  Purchased Hidango's Calc Plus.
		order number is:  12529019
		and activation key is: 2RYP14HEYM
	

---20070120

	1)  got new version of tree working using xmlmenu from session.  Still reads xsl in, but can cache that also in session.
	2)  Need to add proper links in UIMenu and get employee list working same.
	3)  make each link do a target= proper frame!
	4)  Should probably just create an xml file with the process menus laid out.  They could
		have a set of tags about which payroll cycle they should be exposed in.  Absence of the tag
		means they are exposed in all.  Add the actual process names and the role that can start them.
		
	5)  When select employee, set an session variable to the current_selected_employee and put the information from the xml file
		read in once during testing.  Get the ssn, payroll #, and status and put them in session with the current_selected_employee also.
		display them in the little employee browser.  Make the forward and backward arrows actually select the previous and next from the tree!
	

---20070219

	1)  Open .mac web site with http://homepage.mac.com/jwooten37830  for the one under Sites.

	2)  Installed FastTrack into Eclipse 3.2 - seems to be a nice way to track actions
		on work being done.  Discuss with Robert.  ***TODO***
	3)  Downloaded Sbuversion.dmb and installed.  It says it is okay.  But apparently must
		also have a subversion server.  I've set up account btree@OpenSVN.csie.org
		to test it out.  Not working yet.
	4)  Need to learn how to use with Eclipse, etc.  How to set up our own local server.
	5)  Aptis - design summary - last mtg. list of services were gone over - no questions
			use cases from which invoked?  Strategies for moving cache?  Alternative study,
			evaluate them.  Reasonable data, sizes, etc.  Not face to face, not in scope.

---20070226

	1)  Downloaded all chapter examples of the O'Reilly book Ruby on Rails, Up and Running.
		These were put into ~woo/Development/Library as photos-chapter-n.  There was
		some confusion about the names of the files.  They had 7 & 8 but no 6.  There is no
		chapter 8 in the book.  The alignment seemed to be 5,6,7 instead of 5, 7,8.
		***TODO*** Start with the chapter 5 and show images, etc. Learn how to do stylesheets
		view images, etc.
		

---20070227
	
	1)  Attended Interagency mtg.  Met Jennifer who is replacing Pablo.  We have to meet later
		in the week to learn how to help her.  Also Sarah Djuric introduced Joe who is the new program
		manager on Northrup side.  He wants to meet perhaps on Friday.
	2)  Reviewed SNOMed with Bob.  He's working on a set of notes about the mapping process.
	3)  Met with Col. Marenkovitch about Imaging, Aptis, and problems with mapping. Long conversation
		and he wants perhaps a request for a white paper from Aptis about how abstraction will
		be done to prevent vendor binding.  Also, what is status of putting proprietary 3M codes
		as referencial elements in the image repositories.  8-8 day.
	4)  Spent dinner with Bob going over the capture of lessons learned and he roughed out how
		he could do that.  This is billable as it will then be available to Ed on our Wiki.
		

---20070228

	1)  Downloaded and installed WxPerl and tested.  It provides graphics capabilities on
		os x from inside perl.  Run by using wxPerl forth.pl
		the demos are in a folder under Perl in OlderSoftware and there is documentation
		under wxPerl in Documents/Reference.
	2)  Changed password on Wiki at:  http://shoulders.pbwiki.com/ to "should1!" and sent to
		Christine and Bob.  Christine installed a page of pictures.  Bob is working on some
		content about how he does his job at MHS.
	3)  Look at forth.pl and forth.dict the FORGET removes the word, but the word can still be
		executed.
	4)  Installed perlDBv1 under Perl and tested.
	

---20070301

	1)  downloded pforth-v21 a C version, put it into XCode as standard C command line code
		compiled it, created pforth in build/Release/pforth and copied to pforth directory.
		executed it with pforth -i system.fth and it created the pforth.dict.
		Now running it with pforth loads from pforth.dict and executes.
		Need to see what the defs are, etc.  and do more testing.
		***TODO*** read *.fth and understand and test more.
		***TODO*** Figure out how to talk to AquaTerm and create plot there!
	2)  pfcompil.c has the ok\n where one could put the ">" if desired.  Also should
		print out version of code and saved dictionary being used.
		

---20070302

	1)  Create minimal Tomcat webapp with jsps, css, web.xml, and servlet to send to Robert.
	

---20070304

	1)  Create jsp? or servlet that runs and allows a phone to connect and do commands that
		one's mac or pc also connects to, providing credentials and handles those commands.  Like
		from the phone I can do an "ls ~woo" and it gets saved on the server, then when the mac
		connects and identifies itself, it reads the command, executes it in a terminal window,
		then prepares the response and sends it back to the server where it's saved until the
		phone asks for a result and receives it.  Back and forth.  Come up with a set of 
		commands to do system tasks, look up mail, documents, etc. and retrieve and put them.
		

---20070305

	1)  Clear up AppSuite and Meeting Assist, which is most developed, etc.?  Get rid of other.

---20070313

	1)  Worked from 12:30 until 6:00 with Robert on getting a new "demo" site available.
		It is in workspaces/AreteQWebApp and the target directory is the webapps/qServer
		but one has to edit web.xml to point to the demoConfig.ini and in that to the
		location of the controlData.  We need to use a classLoader reader to get to the
		files in a machine independent way.  ***TODO***
		Also, we need to fix the login and logout, etc.
		
	2)  The areteq web site is:  ftp://tetris.dreamhost.com/areteq.com
		and the user/password is:  areteq/ferret, but there is no Tomcat there.
		Charles will work to get that setup on jaysec.

	6)  Downloaded rote from rote.rubyforge.org using:
			sudo gem install -r rote
			Installed into /usr/local as far as can be determined.  Tests stopped failing
				because of lack of ability to include 'rote'  Also this caused a download

	1)  Password for Chase Fraud alert is JWOOTEN37830/random1
	2)  Downloaded aipdf-bin.jar, decompiled and then figured out how to 
		make PDF show up in separate frame.  Text shows up (raw) in regular frame.
		***TODO*** Look at how to bring up pdf in regular frame with paging buttons, etc.
	3)  Downloaded JPedal, and open source PDF viewer and source and API.  It appears
			to be reasonably easy to use as a panel not a frame.  Then extract
			content using api methods?  Alter to get more data on location, etc.?
			

---20070609

	1)  I might need to create a new interface "Configurable" that has a method:
	
			public Object getValue(String name)
			
			public void setValue(String name, Object value)
			
			and a configure(Configurable object)
			
			Then each listener has an empty constructor and is followed by 
				listener.configure(Configurable gui);
				
			QGUI implements Configurable and is passed into MenuBuilder at construction time.
			
			Each listener then can request "by name" the value it needs and it is returned as
				an object.  It is responsible for converting it to the proper type and getting the
				information.  Thus the listener for redact has gui.getValue("textHasValue") checks that the textPane.getText()
				is not empty and returns a new Boolean(true) which is evaluated and if it has value, the redact
				button is enabled.  the open listener does a gui.getValue("hasDictionary") and QGUI
				checks that the path to the dictionary is set and returns a new Boolean() true or false.
				If not set, then the open menu item is disabled.  Thus as soon as the open dictionary item
				is clicked the action handler for it gets the value, and sets it etc.  The notice goes to
				the open item which does the above.

		viewWorkflow.jsp hangs, but needed the jms jar file which I found.
		(clinical client doesn't show place to enter patient id)
	7)  Created FileUtilities.fixDirectoryPath(path, org) to fix up the screwed up
		paths with duplicates, etc.

New Tasking - Cathy wants us to help determine the main point of contact for the MHS Help Desk
	so that we can find out how to set up the Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 help contacts for
	the various JEHRI programs.  The tier 3 will be someone from the vendor for that contract,
	The Tier 1 or 2 might be a Shoulders person.  We need to collect the training materials for
	all of the programs under JEHRI and review them and then figure out the process for training the
	people who will be the help desk assistance for Tier 1, 2, and 3.

Ginsberg's Theorem:
        (1) You can't win.
        (2) You can't break even.
        (3) You can't even quit the game.

Freeman's Commentary on Ginsberg's theorem:
        Every major philosophy that attempts to make life seem
        meaningful is based on the negation of one part of Ginsberg's
        Theorem.  To wit:

        (1) Capitalism is based on the assumption that you can win.
        (2) Socialism is based on the assumption that you can break
            even.
        (3) Mysticism is based on the assumption that you can quit the
            game.

Determined that if I place a script in /etc/weekly.local it will be run weekly by crontab or
	anachrontab.
	
Run ls -al /var/log/*.out to see when scripts were last run.
Created script in alias to run this at terminal startup.
It appears that on the Mac instead of crontab, launchd is used to schedule scripts.
	/System/Library/LaunchDaemons directory contains com.apple.periodic-weekly.plist
	and this points to /usr/bin/periodic with the keystring of "weekly"
	The interval is set there with StartCalendarInterval of Hour=3, Minute=15, Weekday=6 (Sat)
	The /usr/bin/periodic can be run as "periodic weekly" manually.
	
	It checks /etc/defaults/periodic.conf to see if there is a set of additional locations to check
			and if so it sources them.
			It contains references to /etc/periodic.conf.local and /usr/local/etc/periodic
			It sets the weekly_output to /var/log/weekly.log

Created bin/clean_extra_weekly_logs.sh and bin/clean_extra_monthly_logs.sh
	The weekly one works on files in /private/var for *.gz and other dirs for *.gz
	The monthly one checks for files *.log* that are older than 60 days in Tomcat logs and User/woo logs
	I've added these to the /etc/weekly.local and the extra_monthly will check still only for those older than 60 days.
	It ran sucessfully under test mode in sudo periodic weekly and logged to /var/log/weekly.out
	
Downloaded jfreechart and jcommon.  Look at it for charting in the simulations
		How do they do their demo.  I like the look!  
		
Create a new area sc_graphics and have a demo.DemoSplitFrame that shows the frame
	with the tree in the lhs, clicking on a tree item brings up a graph in the top right
		and a reason in the bottom right.  If no class found, brings up default error msg in both.

NOW,  See if we can put the wf_editor into this framework by having the appications
	in the tree with the processes under them.  Clicking them bring us in the top right to edit, etc.
	What shows up in the bottom right?
	
Look up CVSGrab

Created DemoSplitFrame that runs JavaDrawViewer.  When you select a tool it creates
	the figure in the scroll pane.
	Clickikng on a tree Item causes a valueChanged message to go to DemoSplitFrame.
		There it creates a DisplayDemo class from the description and fills in the bottom
			with the html file from the description.
	Now, how to handle if the item on the left is the name of a business process?
	We want it to read in the process and create the panel just as DisplayDemo does, i think.
	We add the panels as tabs? each has a scroll pane.  We keep a list of them in the Windows menu.
	We put the results of selecting something into the bottom window.
	Create the menus using my menu builder, but the Windows one is dynamic and the
		apps and processes are dynamic, reading the directories under the organization/applications
		
	We put the different kinds of editors ( each a "JavaDrawViewer" ) into the Editors Menu
		and use that to swap the kind of editor from workFlow to Simulation to Actions, etc.
		
	I need to factor out the parts of JavaDrawViewer that are the "framework" for each editor.
	
DemoSplitFrame shows a ProcessEditor getting created via the menu
	and some charts being created via the tree.  The processView retains its figures between
	viewing other charts. The list of windows gets added to and changes the title and description
	when a Window is selected.  There needs to be an asterisk beside the selected window
	AND the drawing itself is not being switched!  I think I can keep the drawing with the name
	of the window in a hashMap and just restore it?  Did that with hashmap.
	When a process is selected in the tree, and added to windows, it needs to have an asterisk.
	When a process is selected in the Windows menu, it needs to change the asterisk and highlight
	the proper tree item!  Use notifiers where possible.  Add a ShowProcessItemListener
	so that each windows menu item gets hit in turn.  If the name is right, we set the "key" icon
	and if not we turn it off.  We also in the menuhandler for the windows menu see if we can
	make the TreeNodes be notifiable via extending them.  Then they check to see if they are the right
	node and if so highlight, else unhighlight.
	
Factor out the JDrawingView stuff from DemoSplitPane and put it elsewhere.  I want to have
	another editor to be able to add.  It could be real different.  So a lot  of stuff about
	drawings go into JavaDrawViewer instead of DemoSplitPanel. 
	

---20070909

Create a set of tabs across the bottom of the bottom right window in DemoSplitPane.
	Those are the "views", docs(present), tasks( or todo on this perspective ), properties ( for
	when you click on a figure, etc. ).

Extract an interface from JavaDrawViewer that others can implement such as an ActionEditor.
	Abstract class here for common behavior?

Have a Project menu?  Have preferences for the project like which views to show at bottom right
	Which editors are available, for the left panel, what perspectives are available? 
	Also add in File menu the New... which will allow creating new Application (?), New Process
	under current application ( where does that show ? in tree? ), New organization (again at top of
	the tree? )
	
Organize and now do first thing of extracting all JDrawingView stuff from DemoSplitPane.
	Create the new notifiable Tree Node first.  Replace drawingEditor by currentDrawingEditor.
	
Created TAG with REFACTORED_FOR_MODULAR_EDITOR that has wf_editor working and the new
	DemoSplitFrame version swapping, etc.  Still needs refactoring of editor into editor.
	Can't get Tree of processes to update when the process node listener gets a message that it
	should highlight and the others de-highlight.  At beginning, the things added to the Windows
	menu aren't highlighted either as they are added.  Should be.  Got the tab closer to work and
	the drawing closer sending the right messages.  Need to remove the window from the view now
	and also have a Project with preferences and show views, show Perspectives,etc.  Necessary
	to add back in the doc if closed.

Retrieve email from Josh on OpenAir summary for previous month
Save into Projects/CITPO/AuditBackup as OpenAir_YYMMDD.xls
Make a copy of the previous monthlyYYYYMM.xls and rename it to monthlyYYYYM+.xls where M+ is
	the month reporting on.  Example in Sept, the report will be for Aug and the prevous will be 
	July.  Copy monthly200707.xls and rename it monthly200708.xls.  The OpenAir_070831.xls should
	already have been saved in 1 above.
Sort the OpenAir_YYMMDD.xls on Task, Date, User and save.
I create a formula in the column (H) at the bottom of each Task type and 
	enter =sum(Dt:Db)+sum(Et:Eb)/60, where t os the beginnig row for the task type
	and b is the row number of the bottom task item of a given type, e.g. Data Management
	This produces the total hours for that task type.  I make sure the cell is formatted to show
	to the tenths. ( i.e. one decimal place ).
	
	Repeat this for the task types. Sum them for the total.
	I then create one more which is total - ProjectManagement total and that is total engineering support
	
Save the file.

Open the monthlyYYYYMM.xls for this report ( previous month to present month ).
Select the tab for Performance from Mar 11 ( ask Bob Stults )
If at the top there isn't a section for the month reporting on, copy the previous section and insert
	it.  Be sure to fix all references, etc. ( I was lucky this month and i had already created one ).
	If created properly, there shoudl be %allocated, hours allocated, planned hours, and an empty actual
	hours.  This is where the numbers from the OpenAir go.
Carefully ( using esc a lot of times ) hand enter the data ( Excel can't copy the data easily
	from one sheet to another ), and then check that the references for the new cells seem reasonable.
	Then be sure the cumulative variance is right ( ask Bob Stults ).
Remember the column number for the last entry. e.g. AK for Aug
Scroll back to where the plot is.  Click on each line, note the pattern e.g. 
		=SERIES("Data Management",,('Performance from Mar 11'!$G$4,'Performance from Mar 11'!$M$4,'Performance from Mar 11'!$S$4,'Performance from Mar 11'!$Y$4,'Performance from Mar 11'!$AE$4),2)
		for DataManagement.  
		Copy from the last ',' up to but not including the ')'.  Paste that at the end.
		Then alter the column in this entry to be AK for instance. (The column you remembered before).
Repeat for each line in the graph.
At the bottom of the legend, add a line for this entry, i.e. 7 = Aug07 or whatever.
Save the worksheet
Close the openAir worksheet.
Click on the Progress tab in the monthly report.
Enter/alter any data that is significant, and place the proper item into the task matrix
	at the top.
Click on Narrative tab at bottom and update/enter narrative data about previous month.  Some
	can come from previous statements from open air if significant.
Save the sheet.
Locate the transmittalOfMMMYYPerformanceAndProgress.txt from the last month.
Change all occurrences of the previous month to the present month.  DON't change the 
	deliverable number.  It is always 2.  Deliverable 2 is to provide a monthly report!
	Save this with MMMYY changed to Aug07 for instance.
Prepare an email using this as the information in the body.  Be sure the to addresses
	are correct.  The support center must be the primary receipient.
Send this off by the 15th of the month!  DON'T forget to attach the monthlyYYYYMM.xls spreadsheet!


Apparently I threw away my ubuntu-6.10-i386...iso disk image from downloads and thus Linux
	won't start.  NOTE TO SELF... MOVE THINGS LIKE THIS TO ANOTHER PLACE.
	NEED TO RE-DOWNLOAD ubuntu for i386 and install.  Use fast line.  It is almost a gig.
	
Downloading dsl-3.1.iso damn small linux.  Need to remove the ubuntu and install this one.

Discovered that after I moved dsl-3.1.iso to Backups and then in the Linux vm
		set it to point to that for the CD, that low and behold, what came up was Ubuntu
		as I guess that's what was in the HD that I had configured.  I just needed something to 
		cause the boot up?  Anyway, it works now and seems okay.  Will do more.  There are lots of
		applications out there!
		
		The popup menu is by control-shift-click and select.
		To remove a remote server ( i.e. to unmount something ) select it in places
		and click to get the popup and remove it.
		DO MORE STUFF HERE TO SEE WHAT I CAN DO WITH UBUNTU .
		
Got submenus to work with MenuBuilder.  The New Organization, Application, Process show up.
Still When click on tree, the resulting item in the menu isn't highlighted.  Fixed this
	problem.  It turned out that I wasn't notifying if the window was new.
	Still don't know how to set the selected condition on a tree node.
	
Can't get treePath correct, throws class cast exception.  More research

Have DemoSplitFrame now responding to the Windows, highlighting the proper tree item,
	and vice-versa.  Also, when the close button is clicked on a window it is removed from the

	Tasks will have data in it at least. TAG="TASKS_TAB_SWITCHES_NO_MOUSE_PROBLEM"
Getting some kind of mouse problem in the dissplay panel which goes away if I first click
	on a palette item.  Acts like there is no default tool selected or such.
	***DONE***  this was failure to set fTool at end of init in DrawingPanel.  TAG="TASKS_TAB_SWITCHES_NO_MOUSE_PROBLEM"

Downloaded viewvc-1.0.4, rcs-5.7, and diffutils-2.8.1 and placed in Development/Utilities/cvsView
Tested by editing the standalone.py to point to my Python installation launcher.
	Then in viewvc-1.0.4 typed bin/standalone.py -r /Users/woo/cvsrep
	Then opened browser to http://localhost:7467/viewvc/
	and this brings upt the viewer in a limited way.
	Still ***TODO*** need to install via ./viewvc-install and so forth
	integrate with either the standard port 80 server via instructions
	
Also downloaded cvsgraph-1.6.1 tarball version into same directory
did the ./viewvc-install and installed into /Users/woo/Sites/viewvc-1.0.4
Edited the viewvc.conf in the installed location and set the cvsroot to /Users/woo/cvsrep
copied the cgi scripts (*.cgi) from bin/cgi in the installation directory to
	/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables.  Stopped the server from the Preferences panel
	by clicking on stop personal websharing and restarted it.
	Typed http://localhost/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi
	and the cvs view appeared ( I had changed my address at the bottom and it showed up also ).
	I then edited my index.html in my ~woo/Sites to include the cvs link and that works!
Still need to install rcs-5.7, diffutils-2.8.1, and then cvsgraph-1.6.1 and edit
	the viewvc.conf to tell it where these things are installed.
Downloaded and installed i2GCal.scpt in /Library/Scripts/Mail.  I added a rule
	to the mail box to have it run the script if it finds an attachment ending with .ics.
	What I don't understand is how it connects to my google mail? ( It doesn't work, btw ).
	

---20070912

Fixed the display of the title of the window to be a JLabel so it shows without a border.
Got background to finally be white, appears to be the view?
Got ActivityCreation Tool to create the Activity figure ( using demo.creationTools version)
	Still need to implement update in the FigureEditor implementation since it is what
	adds the state to the model, or the process to the application. ***TODO***
	Use the pn we receive when we are creating the diagram to keep track of the current
	Application and process!  ProcessNode currentSelection;  Would like the background to be
	a very light gray. This is in DrawingPanel ***TODO*** make faint outline around border of Activity.
Add a gradient to the title bar like in the ActivityFigure.   ***TODO***
Change Demos to "Editor"
Have ability to create Activities and link them in diagram.  need to implement the adding to 
	application and processes, etc.  
Add elbow connector and angle connector so that when they are connected between states
	they ask for the name of the transition!  They create the linkFigure and I remove it from the
	palette.  Depending upon the choice of connectors when laying out, it is either an angle or
	an elbow connection.  May just extend the simple elbow they already have for first test.
Why doesn't double clicking on ActivityFigure bring up properties browser?

HOW TO CHANGE SCALE?  Can I have each figure be a notification listener and get the scaling information 
	and the drawing also get the information and everything resets its scale factor so that
	the paint method uses it?  OR, could I in the panel, in panel override the paint method
	to pick up the graphics and do an affine transformation by the scale factor and then to super.paint(g)?
	***DONE*** The scaling is being picked up, etc. but, OF COURSE,  the mouse contains is WRONG
	Will need to have local copies of the figures and get the scaling to set the contains correctly
	***TODO***
PRIORITIES:

		1)  Read in the StateModel if not in memory on first click.
		2)  Use to do layout as in wf_editor ( just the reading of existing ones ).
		3)  Figure out why the dbl click isn't working and fix.  Probably the figure
			isn't handling it's own dbl-clicks and that logic is in wf_editor ( refactor in this case )
			NEW FIGURES.
		4)  Add logic for saving, etc as from wf_editor, but through actions.
		5)  Copy ActivityDependency and correct it so that it allows drag from state to state
			and asks for transition event name.  Creates link figure and connects it.
Built and installed rcs-5.7 using ./configure, make, sudo make install, make clean
	and also diffutils-2.8.1
	Failed to install cvsgraph-1.6.1 since it neede GD lib and when I downloaded it and tried a make
		I got a failure in that /usr/local/lib/libpng12.dylib was not found.  More research needed.
		Can't find rpm version to install directly.

      Want to try this with the demo app that had some databases.  metrics_db and preferences_db,
      queue, and queue_db, users_db, and taxdb, entity_db, later advworks?
      
Ran into problems, downloaded new copy of jboss as and put zip into backups.
	reinstalled ( dropped ) expanded into Applicatioins.
	Tried to run eclipse-bpm, but it failed. need to track down.  Use a new copy of this to create
	the jboss seam applications.
	
Used sony's go back to start to recreate 17inch to initial state.  only admin with no password
	there now.  Then right clicked on my computer and brought up computer management/storage
		and clicked on disk management and it shows a view of the drives.
		I selected D and told it to delete the partition, recreate it, and then reformat it.

Sent Robert the SwingGUI, RedactViewer, and MenuDefinition for not showing the thumbnail panel.
	perhaps should have showThumbnails and debug as prefs in the PreferencePanel, but do this by
	overridding the GenericPreferencesPanel and adding new items!
	
Downloaded GPL_SuperWabaSDK for version 5.8.2. move it to windows and install.  Does it provide
	a new runtime?  The one on the phone crashed the phone! I installed this into 
	C:/SuperWabaSDK.  It contains good docs and the .prc and .prb for the runtime on the Palm
	need to read carefully because there are some different options before installing this.
	Also, the development process is tricky.  Some flags need to be set when I compile using the
	standard JVM so that the byte code is the right version for the process.  See documentation.
	
Moved aspectJ workspace to workspaces.  Eclipse 3.0 failed on startup.  Deleting it.
	I think it had the aspectJ plugins!  It did have the aspectJ feature.  ***TODO*** Add this to
	a newer Eclipse possibly.
	
Give new transitions and new states a default State1, Go1, type name and dbl-clicking brings
	up a new panel Properties for: G1 But the split pane to the left has the items like
	General, etc., General for a transition shows the Name: Go1 and allows change.
	Others are listed in the split pane and then shown in the one to the right when clicked.
	Look at how jbpm ide creates the properties pane!  "Properties for"
	For a state we have Handler and it shows the Node Action with checkbox for Configure action
	handler.  You can set the class(with a browse), the configuration type(e.g. Field,Bean,Constructor
	Compatibility
	and for fields you set the field name, and swimlaneName ( i.e. role ).  Look up how this
even though there are errors, you can
	see the Look and Feel.  I like the little icons in the tasks, showing the kind of task?
	Also, the marque on the left, is divided up into the right kinds of things.
	***TODO*** Fix current demo editor so that dragging creates proper things.  IDE for JBoss has
	the split and join icons plus others!!!
	
Be sure to ask when a state is created, with the check box, that it has a "Cancel" or "Suspend"
	added if desired!  ***TODO***  Maybe every state automatically has a "Cancel" node attached!
	In the state properties, we show the outcomes!  Only editable via the act of adding or
	removing a task link.
	
Fixed showing editor logs when I noticed via the weekly cleanup that I had misnamed the
	log directory sw_editor instead of sc_editor.  Now logs to there and will get cleaned up.
	Should direct the digester output to digester.log or such.  I want a log that shows the
	action, the transition, etc. and the user.
	
Hook up the action of selecting from the tree to checking if the state model is in memory
	and then reading it in if not and displaying it.  ***TODO***  Get the icons from the
	jboss ide!
	
Installed Vue-6 a program for creating virtual landscapes.  Code is INST-GSSNY-MPJBD-BXT-VUE6ESL
	need to register.
	

---20070917

Sent copy of current code to Robert as his did not work correctly.  I checked everything in after
	verifying that mine did work.  

Got the PluggableEditor working with reading in the stateModel and displaying it.
	the display of properties depends upon creating a SelectionTool ( override ) and
	in the DisplayPanel and having it tell via the interface the PluggableEditor to create
	a new tab if it doesn't exist and have it be added to the set of Views, plus that is where the
	info on the objects will go and get selected when it occurs.
	
Change to use nicer icons in palette!
	BP.gif
	newreadme_wiz.gif "eye glasses"
	

---20070918

Downloaded jbpm-jpdl-3.2.GA.zip and placed into ~woo/Development/Applications and zipped into
	Backups.
Downloaded eclipse-SDK-3.2.1 carbon tar gz and untarred then compressed and renamed to
	eclipse-SDK-3.2.1.zip and edited build.properties in the pdl area to point to Backups and that
	file and with terminal pointing to jpdl/designer, typed ant install to install Eclipse.
	
That did not work.  removed jpdl entirely.  copied zip file in to directory Development/Applications
	and unzipped.  Then copied in separately the zip for the eclipse and unzipped.
	Tested that that worked.  Then carefully copied from the designer/eclipse, the contents
	of features to eclipse/features, contents of plugins to eclipse/plugins, and folder links
	to exlipse/
	Then started in a new workspace of designer/eclipse/workspace and new project/jbpm gives
	me a sample diagram.  Removed the designer eclipse and moved this eclipse into its area.
	tested again and works.
	Note the very nice tabs at bottom of view iwth Diagram, Swimlanes, deployment, source!!! 
	Also have all the icons now in my Desktop/images!  Can put those into PluggableEditor
	and build it to look like theirs!!
	
	I also like having the tab at the top for the process!  have more than one open at a time.
	Tools are:
	Select with arrow
	Marquee with square and cross at bottom right - selects nodes only
	separator
	Start with green circle and right arrow
	State with arrow pointing to small green circle
	End with square red box
	separator
	Fork
	Join
	Decision
	Node with geared wheel 
	Task Node with check mark on pages ( diff between node and task node?)
	Process State with arrow pointing to pages
	SuperState 
	separator
	Transition with arrow
	
	Name of state is in tab box at top.
	
to the JBPM?
	
Add the panes as tabbed panes with thename of the process as the tab.  Don't create
	the "process" node like I have been.
	Change icons now and wire them up.
	

---20070919

Sent foia_1_5.zip to Charles.  Notes about lack of zoom repaint, rotate works, other issues.
Got the drag and connect to wok in editor, but now need to be sure state model is updated and 
	marked dirty.  Then look at creation from the start via the Menu item New...
Review where things are in the demo packages.  Need to organize better as interfaces, etc.
	Then move to regular structure or new package?  Find and fix and remove hard-coded
		paths and "Shoulders". Login to get information?
Going to try to change tool palette so it looks better.

Added to properties so it shows type = State Model, etc. and the name
	it will then add a different subpanel below for the different types.
	They will extend a BasicPropertiesPanel that gives description, and a few common items
	Look at JBoss to see the way they did their tab with Parameters, Source, etc.
	
Fix so that all little panes may be minimized and maximized?  May need to create a little panel
	that goes at the upper right that holds all three of these things!
	
When a window is closed, then go to menu and get last one and open it and set tree.

Made all extend DescriptionPane and have notification listeners so they can do their thing.
	Properties pane right now, removes itself.  TaskView gets set to General.  Would be
	different if a menu item were selected if any there.
	
Now that notifications are working, have the Pluggable Editor listening also and it
	checks for a minimize/maximize and the source.  If from the top and expands, sets divider to
	100%, otherwise back to 75%?
	
Images are being drawn, but area is too small and they get "clipped".  How to handle?
Got tool pallete looking sort of like I wanted.  Add icons to the states.
	Need to have a preferences where one can hide the names of the tools.  Make them be notification
	listeners and if told to hide words, they hide them.

Received deposit of 1765.91 extra this two weeks.  Regular deposite was 3845.87.
	Check on what this implies.  It could mean that I'm owed a total of $229,568.30 back pay.
	But, did it include 451.xx insurance pay?  Check it out before counting on it.
	Tom said that we'd pay bi-weekly like this over 5 years to make up lost pay.
	If that had insurance added, the net would still be 1308.86 and that would represent
	$170,151.80 back pay.  This could also have taxes taken out, but sent note to Josh to find

Should the close button in the demo process editor change the selected path
	in the tree to the next higher node? and that would also show the documentation
	about the application, organization, etc.
Selecting the Application node should show the application documentation!
	Probably have to create an applicationNode and an organization node?


---20071001

The demo editor is adding a Do 1 Do 2 etc between states that are not linked in the
	xml.  Also, the diagram size is somehow not right.
getDescription isn't returning the description correctly for the statemodel, activity, or link
	?
Look at the demo memory usage as an  example of having a "ticking" chart collecting data.

After creating new project in seam try (for existing tables)

	seam generate-entities

	seam restart.  Failed but got further along.
	
	Also, Had to put in persistence.xml a line about the hibernate dialect.

go the Pluggable Editor to show the documents.  It was using a variable organization that was
	null instead of the pn.getOrganization().
Added logic to begin to handle showing the application documents and the organization documents
	Right now they show an empty figure with a bad title.  Organization should probably show
		and org chart and org docs while application should show some app chart and 
			the app documentation ( ***DONE*** ).  Properties doesn't show right and neither does
			the figure, of course.  ***TODO***
Fix the bottom pane so it can get bigger!  ***TODO***
Menus and Tree are now synched for Organizations, Applications, and Processes,
	BUT, the drawing is NOT correct for Organizations and Applications.  ***TODO***
When a drawing is removed, perhaps we should scroll to the Top of the Tree
When the summary or the application doc shows, it does not have the proper selected
	item at the top.  A problem in creating docs, I think.  Also, the links don't work
	in the view I'm using.
X should only show on panel that is selected!  When mousing over, it can show?
DrawingPanel receives a selection changed message for the element, but it doesn't show
	in the properties panel unless I dbl click and then if I dbl click in another it creates
		a link!  Need to fix the select.
		Fix the select and then add showing data elements, adding cancel button!
Clicking on tree for app or organization should create a different editor? and drawing!
What does process editor selection do?  It seems to clear drawing.
Implement New/Application..New/organization.. new Process.  first two just
		add a folder!, last creates a statemachine, etc. in memory.
Look at the state of the stateMachine and see about writing it out.  Then add stuff as needed
	to be sure new additions and deletions are handled.

Create a new seam project with Person, User, and Role entities.  Use the template, and style sheet from the seam_login to get things right
Call the project step1.

Use the way the top menu.xhtml does to get the list of *.seam items and use that for Workspaces on the left navigation.
 3)  save that and be sure it works correctly.

Then create step2 ( do I copy or what ), and 
	add the many to many and the search, etc.

Then add the authentication using the authentication rules but have the dev script create an initial user, etc.

Then create step3 where I add one business process.  Be sure that I put all of the control of the pages so you have to be logged in, etc.  Have a task list and explore how that is to be used.

Then look at how to create the statistics, history, etc. pages for this and call it step 4.

Consider a short book that has this as a example of building a business process framework using seam. !!!

Where does the application get the /seam_login/UserLIst.seam and what is necessary for that to exist?

Add the things that cause you to go to login if not logged in, and restrict view of workspaces if not logged in.  I.e. it will show something different.
This will complete step1

step2 will add entities.
