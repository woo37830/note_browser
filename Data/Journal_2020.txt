NOTE THAT THERE ARE PASSWORDS AND KEYS IN HERE AND SHOULD BE PROTECTED.

Go to aws.amazon.com and either create an account or log into your account.
If you don't have an instance then create a small free one. Add security resources for SSH on port 22,
then http resources on port 80, 0.0.0.0/0
Assign an elastic-ip and associate it with the instance.

If you do, then 'spin up' the instance by clicking on it, noting the elastic-ip and then click on Actions/State/Start
The instance should start up. after it has started, then from a terminal window, follow the below after ssh ec2-user@elastic-ip and login.

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-22-116 ~]$ history
1 yum -y install httpd
2 sudo yum -y install httpd
3 sudo yum -y install php
4 httpd -v
5 php -v
6 sudo service httpd start
9 sudo usermod -a -G apache ec2-user
10 exit
11 groups
12 sudo chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www
13 sudo chmod 2775 /var/www
14 find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} \;
15 find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} \;
16 echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
17 sudo rm -rf /etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf
18 sudo service httpd restart
.. http://elastic-ip/phpinfo.php (make sure this works)
19 sudo yum install git
20 cd /var/www/html
21 sudo git clone https://github.com/woo37830/patti.git
22 copy the config.ini.php file from Trello into /var/www/html/patti/webhook/
23 Do http://elastic-ip/patti/index.html (Documentation page should show)

NOTE that if you don't want to be charged while testing, you should shut down the instance when done testing. It appears that this tier costs:
2.15/750 Hrs so a year would cost about $25. We need to check this.

Install mysqld via

sudo yum install mysql-server
sudo chkconfig mysqld on
sudo service mysqld start
/usr/libexec/mysql55/mysqladmin -u root password 'random1'

In order to be sure httpd and mysqld are started on start and reboot,

sudo chkconfig mysqld on
sudo chkconfig httpd on
sudo chkconfig --list (check for mysqld and httpd)

To install the users_db database, import the users_db.sql files resulting from a sql dump of the database originally stored on jwooten37830.com, viz.

On jwooten37830.com use the phpmyadmin tab from the jwooten37830.com/home/index.html. Log in with woo/passwd
Then select the users_db database from the left column, then from the actions at the top, select export.
Click the quick export and it will result in a users_db.sql file saved to your default file save area ( Downloads on my server ).
Using sftp from the AWS instance:

sftp woo@jwooten37830.com
cd location of the users_db.sql file
ls ( be sure its there )
get users_db.sql
quit
Now:

mysql -u root -p
create database users_db;
use users_db;
source users_db.sql ( give file path if needed )
should see create statements
show tables;

In the AWS console add the rule to allow mysql access to port 3306 from 0.0.0.0/0
ssh to the instance

mysql -u root -p
(enter root password)
mysql> CREATE USER 'woo'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'random1';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON . TO 'new-userid'@'%';

After completing the permissions described, from a remote terminal session try:

mysql -h elastic-ip -u userid -p
(enter passwd from CREATE USER)
You should be connected to the mysql database on AWS.
Try:

show databases;
( should show several including users_db )
use users_db;
show tables;
select * from users limit 10;
exit

Apparently XCode was dropped by Apple in a recent upgrade to OS.
I did brew install cvs on woo-laptop and it worked.  I then created

get the tree root showing instead of the table.  The clicking on the map

Used perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::DBI' to install DBI to use mysql with perl

---20200610 10:40:43
The above did not work.  Instead used ODBC via:
cpan install DBD::ODBC
Then perl extract-data.pl worked against jwooten37830.com/users_db.

---20200610 14:07:10
Got partial polygon toolTip.  tree not remembering desc and type.
Will create Quantellia.nodes that holds name, desc, and type keyed by nodeId.
Then onSelect will use nodeId to display toolTip on treeNode and
also to fill in CurrentSelectedNode with it's id.  Then polyTool
handleSelector will use that to create the toolTip for the polygon.
Might keep count with node data to do display total.

---20200611 12:21:56
Moved to label-nodes for dashboard to store data on the nodes. 
develop was merged with integration and pushed.
