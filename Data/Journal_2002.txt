---20020104

	1)  Installed xmlStream from Tim into d:\OtherFiles
		Check out how it saves objects to and from disk
		in XML.


---20020105

	1) Expressions NAME == "xxx" throw a failure whether or not
		the value is xxx or xxxx
		*** FIXED 1/6/02 *** problem was publisher was not
		mapping columns correctly plus NAME doesn't get mapped?  Changing to Expression works after fixing
		mapping.
	2) Expressions NAME.length lt 10 throw a failure regardless
		of the length of the name.
		also NAME.length == 10 fails regardless of the name
		length.
		*** FIXED 1/6/02 *** see above
	3) When it fails we're not seeing what action is to be
		performed.


---20020106

	1)  Why is AccessAdapter publishing an event for personnel when only RuleInfo was changed?
	2)  NOW, XMLRegulator works for lt, le, and, etc. BUT
	apparently certain columns in the data don't get transcribed into the XML, like NAME.  Works for EVENT_NAME, EXPRESSION, etc.  DATE doesn't appear, Access uses DATETIME which isn't recognized, ...
	3)  Clean up the printouts.
	4)  Change so that the start thread/stop thread go to logs.
	5)  Catch the failure and cause the action to be displayed.
	6)  Run Jetspeed, get failure and send stack trace and
	    info on Tomcat version, etc. to developers list.
	    ***see below***


---20020107

	1)  Got ListDetail running under Jetspeed.  TopLink jar was missing from Jetspeed jar files.
	2)  Images and jsp's have to be under jetspeed so far.
	3)  After first page, then takes over entire frame.  (should
	it open a new frame?).


---20020305

	1)  Revised the ICS_Servlet to contain the static intializer for the timed task.  Turned it off after testing it and it worked(?) at the 5 minute test, but seemed to break everything on OR server when tried there.
	2)  Error on ICS user edit getting routes?
	3)  Fixed third time.  One problem was faulty math?  Check algorithm!
	    Fixed dual storage of readings.  Was caused by not clearing child
	    vector?  Why is this broken?
	4)  Installed James and configured and tested on woo-vaio.  Installed on
		or server.  Haven't tested yet.
	5)  Need to generate correct new database.
	6)  Need to Test without mail task.
	7)  Turn on mailer and retest.  Why are we getting lockups when mailer is
		turned on?


---20020314

	1)  Had to put newer version of xalan into web_applications/ics/web-inf/lib and rename it to xalan.jar.  Things seem to be okay with that.
	2)  May be getting conflict on database connection when the timed event runs.  might have to put in a "semaphore".
	3)  Error when type in email address and don't back up over the embedded blank that is there.  It throws xml for a loop when it finds an 0xa0.
	4)  Apparently & is not allowed in the text of an XML file.


---20020403

	1)  Created a jar file from the jspsmart classes and put it into ics/lib
		This was so that ant clean wouldn't destroy jspsmart classes.
	2)  Created a copy of Framework/source with all files
	3)  Removed util/graphics from Framework/source
	4)  Removed all but interfaces for tests/navigatorMenu from Framework/source
	5)  Removed portlets from Framework/source
	6)  Created build.xml in Framework/Source/java.  It creates SCFrame.jar in jars.
	7)  Created build.xml in ics/Source/java.  It compiles to web_applications/ics/Web-inf/classes
		a)  It has an option ant framework to compile the framework and if it's different
			to create a jar file and copy it to web_applications/ics/web-inf/lib
	8)  Removed adapters from ICS source
	9)  Changed package name of ShouldersCoreProject in ICS to com.shoulderscorp.ics
	10)  Removed ShouldersCoreProject ... from Shoulders Framework.
	11) Changed ListCustomerSites HMTL to rename to George to test path
	12)  Changed DhHyperlinkComponent to not put in the onClick to test html
		Under SOME circumstances, the xml isn't read in and used.  Somehow ListCustomerSites
			ends up with "help.html" instead of "http://localhost:8080/ics/Help.html" which
			is in the xml file. **** ???? ****
			*** Test what is in the attr list ***.
			Add a dump attributes to DhHyperLinkComponent to see what's being passed.


---20020404

	1)  Problem with 404 error in help was the file was named Help.html, but the reference was help.html
	2)  The problem with the ListSites showing the wrong href was that it was on the xml page twice.
		the second time was the one we were seeing!!
	3)  We now figured out that we can create an ics/help directory and put into it
		ListSites.html, EditSites.html, ... help files and in the href part of the hyperlink
		we put "help/ListSites.html" or whatever for now.
	4)  We need to extend DhHyperlinkComponent and create DhHelpLinkComponent, register it in the factory, etc.  It will prepend the browser language to get "en-us/help/ListSites.html" or such.
	Then in the xml, we put <helplink not hyperlink for helplinks.
	5)  *** We need to collect the error messages in a vector, put them in the session,
		then when building the page, get the errormessages and display them.
		If errors, don't save a page if save is pressed.

	*** Problem with help files is temporarily solved for english using 3 above.


---20020405

	1)  In InfixExpressionEvaluator and other evaluators, instead of throwing a RuleViolationException
		we notifyListeners of a rule violation.
	2)  In Regulator, after the rules have been applied, we query the ErrorQueue to see if there
		were any errors.  If none then continue.  Else we throw a new RuleViolationException.
	3)  In PassivateInstance, we then place try catch around the put clause and catch the
		RuleViolation Exception.  Determine the action to revert to the previous state.
		This might be passed up to Applications controlling servlet.
	3a) e.g. In ShouldersServlet, the root of all of our servlets, we determine
		the nextState and then evaluate it.  If it throws a RuleViolationException
		we can revert to the previous state.
		a)  The problem with this is that the previous state may not be a "manual" state
			that has a screen.  So we would have to "back up" until we found one.
		b)  The navigator would have to keep a history for each process of the previous states.

		NOTE:  I am of the opinion that we should change the framework here so that
			each activity can through configuration have an optional "actions".
			which specifies the class to use and the button label for that action.
			We would use the same PassivateInstance effectively, but if that
			passivateAction were present in the namedObject set, we would get the button
			name and place it on the screen. e.g. "Save".  That action would be compared
			against the set of actions internally and if matched would instantiate the class
			and invoke its evaluate method on the itemOfActivity.
			This would eliminate the "Save" from having to be explicitely added to the
			workflow.

	4)  In the standard states, we determine if the ErrorQueue is none empty and display its contents
		on the screen and then clear the ErrorQueue.
	5)  In the setup we create a new ErrorQueue for the navigator in question and
		add it as a listener to the notifier.  The ErrorQueue must be capable of being
		located and queried as to its state. There is one for each navigator.  Where to hold it?  Navigator has a method to return its ErrorQueue.


---20020406

	1)  Placed log4j.xml under web_applications/ics/WEB-INF/classes
	2)  Added log4j imports to several classes with static
		initializer for log.
	3)  Added log.debug, etc. to where I discovered System.xxx.printlns.
	4)  Tested configuring the logger.  Appears to work.
	5)  *** TODO:  need to check in changes.
	6)  Be sure that the jar files are correct for both Framework and ICS
	7)  Test using a jsp to change the logging level while the
		application is running.
	8)  Be sure to do bills.
	9)  Update log book.
	10) Invoice Josh.
	11) Begin adding the Rule handling code.
	12) See if we can handle the actions part first, then redo the
		workflow.

	13)  Create RuleViolationElement.java
	14)  Create RuleViolationException.java
		has to have getElements() which returns a vector
		of RuleViolationElements.
	15)  Catch block in Archiver will extract the RuleViolationElements
		and concatenate them with other obs elements.
	16)  If violations.size() > 0, then we don't persist but
		notify listeners with the list of violations.


---20020407

	1)  Implemented above.
	2)  Testing indicates nothing is broken?
	3)  Need to establish a rule on some field so I can see it evaluated.
	4)  Then break it.


---20020409

	1)  In Assemble, added methods to get Assemble.MESSAGES from arguments
	2)  In ShouldersServlet, added putting error vector into navigator.
		This needs to be removed at beginning of page? **DONE 4/11
	3)  We are getting 14 errors off of one first name > 24 characters!!!! **error in having path name in Regulator causing reload.
	4)  Not building rest of page after we get error page.** works at end of page.  Could there be a special character, try a simple message.
	5)  Need to get error message from error Element to display.
	6)  Add tags to other pages.
	7)  Appears we have to refresh after creating error messages.  HOW???
	 **DONE 4/11


---20020410

	1)  Rule has private static hashtable of evaluators and rules.
		this needs to be on an application specific basis.
	2)  Archiver is currently returning the original object after creating a duplicate to use for comparison when saving.  i.e. only saves changed objects.
	3)  TOPLink has original.  Each reference via query to get an object results in TOPLink returning same original.  If invalid data is set to the original object, then every reference to that object returns invalid data.
	4)  If invalid data is attempted to be saved and fails, a subsequent attempt appears to suceed since the object that is fetched to create the screen is the bad original.  Since the data now is the same as the original, the isDirty returns false.  The bad data does not get saved, but everyone uses it until the server is restarted.
	5)  ***TODO:  Attempt to have archiver store original and return
	the duplicate copy.  This should mean that each attempt to get an object results in a new duplicate for that request.  Changes are made to the duplicate.  IF data is valid, Archiver must copy data into original then persist it.f


---20020411

	1)  Checked into StarTeam framework and ics that had been modified to
		display errors, handle logging, and refresh objects after
		display of error.  Had to resort to refreshing, not using clones.


---20020412

	1)  DataType="Object" is used in EditProductConnection.xml and in TaskDetail.xml.  This causes the DhComboBoxComponent to use other than
	CategoryItems as items for the list.  Note the use of the query.
	Category refers to the Object type the query will be run against as the class.  @1 will refer to the item of activity(currentSelectedItem), I believe.  DhComboBoxComponent is where I want to add the "inspect" button which opens an "ObjectInspector" which shows the instance variables of the object and has <new><save><delete> depending upon
	security roles or information in the xml.

	<product_connection Type="ComboBox"
			Query='contextOwner == (@1)'
			Arguments= "PRODUCT_CONNECTION_SITE"
			Display="name"
			Category ="com.shoulderscorp.ics.modelobjects.Tank"
			Label="Connection"
			VALIDATOR=""
			id="product_connection"
			ClassAccess="PRODUCT_CONNECTION_TANK"
			DataType="Object"
			HelpLink=""
			Required="NO"
			Hint="product connection" />

	2)  Edited DhComboBoxComponent to addInspectorButton using
		a className and an action that could be
			ics/inspector?inspect=className&oid=123
			the last part should be added by the method using
			the oid of the selected object.
	   had to edit DhInputSelect and add method to DhComboBox.

	3)  Have created ObjectInspectorServlet and added it to web.xml for ics.
		a)  It currently gets the message from DhComboBox
			and prints the classname and oid on the screen.
		b)  I need it to open a new browser window to do this.
		c)  I need to be able to get the ApplicationObject for
			the application name and use it for my application
			so that archiver, etc. will work. ** done**
		d)  I can get the object selected by the combo box and
			have it in the ObjectInspector.
		e)  I now need to do the display of its attributes.
			LOOK IN LISTDETAIL FOR WHERE THIS GETS DONE.

	4)  Change so that DhComboBox creates a submit button rather than
		a hyperlink so that the submit goes back to standard with
		a different action.  In ShouldersServlet catch the
		action = Action.inspect and create a new Browser Window
		and use the ObjectInspectorServlet?  This way
		I get the oid argument that was selected by passing in
		with the action, the name of the combobox? so I can get it's value? *** done ** except for new window
	5)  Lay the page in the browser out now with the text boxes, etc.
		*** done ***
	6)  Several of the Objects showing have the right type but the value
		seems wrong. ObjectIdentifier shouldn't have value Mary
		nor should a CategoryItem for Gender have value Mary..
		***FIXED***
	7)  DhComboBox puts two fields on the screen hidden with
		component and className.  IF I put a hidden field
		Action.inspect = inspect on the page and do a simple submit
		then I redirect to the inspector and see the right object.
		BUT, all buttons cause the same submit action!!!
		I need to put the Action.inspect on the page only if
		I click the inspect button.  OR find another way so that
		the inspect button sets the name=Action.action and the
		value="inspect"
		*** done, but get rid of hidden fields ***



---20020413

	1)  Got submit button working using DhSubmitButton.
	2)  Found mistake in routing as reason why the correct person
		wasn't being selected in the combo Box.
	3)  It now selects, inspects, and saves new values in the combo box.
	4)  One problem with changing to Lock="YES", combo box disappears
		and only the oid appears as a label field.  ***ToDo***
	5)  Now to change ObjectInspector to display data as
		another html page with inspectors and text boxes, etc.**DONE**
	6)  Need to add error messages and present them.  ***ToDo***



---20020414

	1)  Inspector is almost working.
		a)  Must do away with hidden fields, since if I have
			two combo boxes with inspectors, then the
			first one overrides the second or later.
		b)  This must be done by creating the information on-the-fly.
			i.e. when the button is pressed. ***TODO***
		c)  Need to add Save, Create buttons. **TODO**

	2)  Still more work to do on errors. **TODO**
	3)  Need to handle Double, Integer, Float, Boolean
	4)  What about boolean?


---20020422

	1)  Prepare $ discussion with Tom.
		a)  When does some salary begin?
		b)  What if this is too long?
		c)  What are our options?

	2)  Prepare a WorkFlowTracker Test Plan
		a)  Requirements
		b)  Glossary of Terms
			i)  What is a Job, Task, Action, Activity, Process
				businessProcess, ActionNode, Cancel, Revert,
				etc.
		c)  Present Package
		d)  Known limitations and solutions
		e)  Test Environment
		f)  Regression Suite
			i)  What is supposed to happen for each test.
			ii) Database tables before test suite starts
			iii) Database tables after each step that involves db.
			iv)  Diff to see changes
			v)  Set up regression log so that we see exactly what
				can be compared and not have times, threads, etc.
		g)

	3)  Look at Dual Portlet Server to get code to add data to a page when button is clicked.  Use this to hand the button clicked name to the page for pickup by Inspector.

	4)  Add error msg and have it contain routename of fields involved.
	5)  In Assemble, check to see if the routeName is one of the fields
		in an error message and if so use style sheet to highlight field.  Same for required field.  Only display error msg.

	4)  Notes to Tim on WFT Test Plan
	5)  Add TimedEventTask as an option that gets done only once.


---20020503

	1)  Give my Framework and ICS to Tim and synch up.
	2)  Get back new Application, etc.
	3)  Get ICS working with new framework.
	4)  Copy down Producer to demo to Cary.
	5)  Fix Rule to have Hashtable as a non-static
	6)


---20020506

	1)  It appears that we need to change the name of Activity to ActivityNode.
	2)  Change it in all config files, *.java files, and in ShouldersProject.
	2a)  This means that TransitionLinks connect ActivityNodes.
	2b)  Code(navigator should run exactly as it does now, just a class name change).
	3)  Test with ActivityNode replacing Activity.
	4)  Create a copy of ActivityNode that is now named Activity.
	5)  In ActivityNode add an instance variable activity with type either State or Process.  add the get and setter.
	5b)  Now in the workflow builder(loader?), we create ActivityNodes and set the activity to them, the links still connect the ActivityNodes.
	5c)  This means that the same activityName can be reused multiple times in the same BusinessProcess with different outcomes each time.
	5d)  Note that ActivityNodes don't have names or at least they don't matter.  They are just holders for the activities and places for the Links to connect to.
	6)  in ActivityNode adjust the accessors and mutators so that they provide the correct behavior IF there isn't an activity set in ActivityNode and they return the action from the activity IF it is present, otherwise from the activityNode.
	7)  Add Activity and instance variable to the ShouldersProject.
	8)  Change BusinessProcess to inherit from Activity and for both activity and business process to have variable initialSubActivity of type Process.
	9)  In business process returns initialSubactivity by method, in activty throws error.
	10)  Run a simple workflow of a BusinessProcess with 2 activities in JBuilder, being sure that the correct handling is done.  If not, we need to fix.
	11)  Later we have to add the role obtaining and other behavior from the old work flow package ( like ADP) to the defaultSheduling or defaultQueuingPolicy so that the more complex possibilities are handled.

	Accomplished
	1)  moved most of src into src_framwork so that src was product specific and src_framework wasn't.
	2)  worked on the build.xml so that it would build correctly.
	3)  Failing now during passivate of the Navigator.  not sure the
		ShouldersProject is getting loaded correctly or such.
		However, the user is being found.


---20020507

	1)  Created TestApplication located in regressionSuite/com/shoulderscorp.
		It uses file config.xml to set up archivers, etc.
		adjusted build.xmls so that they compile everything.
	2)  Created regressionSuite/com/shoulderscorp/workflow/BusinessProcessTest
		to begin testing using new framework.  Added mySetup and myTeardown.  Tested for proper cleanup, etc.
	3)  Altered the businessProcess so it has new initialActivity, extends Activity and changed tables and ShouldersCoreProject to make reasonably consistent.
	4)  Tested that businessprocess can be saved and recovered with initialActivity.
	5)  Simplified TestApplication so it had no extra junk not needed in these simple tests.
	6)  TODO:  Create tests for ProcessContext, etc.
		   Do a short workflow and test.
	7)  Created DatabaseMapTest and got it to read in the descriptors.
		TODO:  Add getting data from map.
			Add using it to save data item.


---20020508

	1)  Created StandardDatabaseAdapterTest and ran sucessfully.
	2)  Created ArchiverTest and ran with TOPLINK and STANDARD
		Toplink okay, STANDARD gives initial messages, but seems okay?
	3)  Created beginning of WorkFlowTest.
		TODO:  create action that execute method prints a string telling what activity it's in.
		create links and then magically run the workflow.


---20020509

	1)  S. Seibert charge to PW23 through 4/12 Pclaim
	2)  LM workpackage corres is n67g90 on Excel ss and Eric
	3)  spoke to s seibert
	4)


---20020513

	1)  Seems I'm missing some routeNames for queuing and process scheduling.
	2)  Getting an extra "T1" when testing?
	3)  Not getting an action from Activity1?


---20020515

	1)  Placed sc_producer/src_framework into cvs.
	2)  had to explicitely add core?  it didn't add by itself.
	3)  method
		a)  create d:/cvs directory
		b)  cd d:/sc_producer
		c)  cd src_framework/com
		d)  cvs import -m "message" sc_producer/src_framework/com shoulders start
		e)  cd shoulderscorp/core
		f)  cvs import -m "message" sc_producer/src_framework/com/shoulderscorp/core shoulders start
	4)  Then to retrieve
		a)  cd d:/sc_producer
		b)  cvs checkout sc_producer/src_framework/com/shoulderscorp/adapters/dataio/AdapterFactory.java
		IF message move it away appears, then need to remove old file first.  It hasn't been checked out properly.

	5)  After edits
		cvs commit -m "message" sc_producer/src_framework/com/shoulderscorp/adapters/dataio/AdapterFactory.java

		Somehow the version numbers are 1.1.1.1... why?
		These indicate that I've created a branch.

		on 5/16 try to remove the cvs directory. then remove all of the
			cvs directories in the src_framework, then recreate
			cvs main directory and add as above.  Check what the version numbers are.


---20020516

	1)  Removed every vestige I could find of cvs.  Then reimported as above.
		STILL get that everything is a branch.
		Need to look up how to start over!!!


---20020529

	1)  Started using RCS with much better success.
	2)  Downloaded from Starteam the Development/Products/SC_Framework
		Attempting to resolve differences and how to get it working.
	3)  Downloaded MFoGo for palm.  haven't gotten key to activate although paid $20.



---20020604

	1)  Got workflow.WorkFlowTest working reasonably, but
		*** NOTE ***
		There does not appear to be enough information to restart
		a queued activity.  The process scheduler holds a transient
		stack of processes, but it goes away when server would stop.
		Some merge of workflowtracker's Job, StackedJob, etc needs to be
		done.  The workflow package doesn't handle business processes very well.
	2)  Put workflowtracker package into regression suite so I can test it
		also.  *** need to add building the business process.
		I'll try to do exactly what I did in WorkFlow Test ( maybe
		put that in a BusinessProcessUtility class to use in both.


---20020605

	1)  Created new package tasktracker to try to reFactor job , etc.
		to new Navigator interface and messaging.
	2)  Moved tests to package tests.
	3)  Compiled.
	4)  Saving objects fails(no final!)
	5)  Problem with BusinessProcess, it has a workCenter and that
		has a Queue.  I need to get the descriptors for
		the ProcessQueue, ProcessQueueEntry, Job, JobTracker,
		StackedActivity, StackedActivityParent. Also
		create the tables!


---20020606

	1)  Steve Seibert called.  Spoke to Janalea, Dan and or Julie need to
		give some direction with Janalea out.  ... only SAP!
		Cautious about what is to be done.  Information changes daily
		even in requirments teams.  Can't spend money on other than sap until approved by mgmt.  Waiting on Julie?
	2)  Wrote TOPLinkDescriptorBuilder to create the descriptor entries
		from the variables, etc.  now parses.  ** Add creation of outputs.


---20020607

	1)  Finished the rough working TOPLinkDescriptorBuilder.  It seems to create a correct
		TOPLInk descriptor.  It needs to be extended to print out the Table description also.  Job.tbl or something.


---20020610

	1)  Need to add end activity to each end of work flow.
		Not getting next transition link after 1st activity?
		Queries need to be sure to do .and(new ExpressionConstructor().get
		Should only mark entry complete IF was executed.


---20020621

	1)  Janalea has me doing:
		a)  Talk to Utpal to get software installed on P6
		b)  What connectivity do we have to P6
		c)  She's driving getting machines for developers
		d)  Might be located in conference room.
		e)  Talk to Ben on Monday about trade study.
		f)  Start looking at Project plan on Monday to help her.

	2)  Finished first cut at a working JobTracker in new Framework.
		a)  Need to see why WorkFlowTest requires SAME navigator to restart
			a queued item.
		b)  Need to refactor into queueing policy, etc.
		c)  Need to determine where and how to have the roleNames, etc.
			they are not on TransitionLinks.
		d)  Is there other information that was in NamedObject sets, that I've
			now put into queues.
		e)  Need to set the item to wait with 15 minute and then mark it active
			if not complete.
		f)  Need to add times, and who serviced the queue entry when marking
			complete.  i.e.  queued, dequeued, serviced by
		g)  Need to write one small task or activity that allows someone to
			queue to a actorRole.  and then dequeue.
		h)  Need to get the timed queue working.  wake up check waiting queue items, if time elapsed, then set active.
		i)  Need to create one test that starts bp4, but doesn't use transactions.  Then separate test that restarts it.
		j)  Create a cleanup first!! (probably copy db, then copy it back).


---20020623

	1)  Cleaned up C drive a bit, removing duplicates of stuff on D.
	2)  Changed so that jboss, tomcat, jakarta stuff all on D.  May have affected
		some applications.  Fixed bat files where noticed.  ICS seems to start
		and jboss starts up.
	3)  Noticed that forte has two folders, fortej, where code is and forte where
		current configuration is.  Keep both!
	4)  Copied over Samples and started on AppMorph.  I need to download cobol code
		and put it into legacy.


---20020627

	1)  Installed Tomcat 4.0
	2)  Tested installing JetSpeed under tomcat 4.0
		http://localhost:8080/manager/install?path=/jetspeed&war=jar:file://D:/jakarta/jetspeed-1.3a2-release.jetspeed.war!/


---20020704

	1)  RCI Points Number to call:  1.877.968.7476


---20020709

	1)  Downloaded ejb_framework and put it into d:\Development\Projects
		This appears to be a self discovering framework whereby "services" are
		added and configured.  Handles logging, configuration, JDBC? etc.  Works with JBoss.  Look at as a way to provide some framework features
		for Customs Portal.
	2)  Updated CVS for sc_producer/regressionSuite and src_framework.
		Not clear what is in d:/Developer/Projects/sc_framework and regressionSuite.  They should be the same.
	3)  How to move ICS over to new framework.


---20020710

	1)  Installed struts documentation and example into tomcat 4.0 via war files.
		It appears to work.  Studying example documentation.  Sent note to
		Tim and Denny about struts.


---20020711

	1)  Created new Documents/struts/ics which is derived from struts-example
	2)  Now to alter Registrations so that they are role names.  See if they get
		saved.
	3)  Then add methods for getting roles, and hasRole to user.
		If Actor doesn't exist for role for user, make one.
		If deleting role for user, delete actor if it exists.
	4)  Try adding behavior for creating/deleting/editing depending on roles and
		Parent of user.


---20020718

	1)  Created JavaProjects/Release1.2_Prototype from Customs...
	2)  Added Adapter, AdapterFactory abstract classes
	3)  Added MyAdapterFactory, MyEaiAdapter, XMLMessage, TestAdapterFactory.
	4)  It compiles and runs and show using factory pattern.


---20020719

	1)  Created Setup.java, CreateBinding.java to create a filebased
		"ldap" for testing.  Setup /tmp/tutorial creates the file area
		where bindings, files, etc. can be stored.
		CreateBinding creates the binding of java:AdapterFactory
		to MyAdapterFactory class.  The MyAdapterFactory class implements
		the methods to create the reference object and instantiate it.
	2)  Tested with run TestAdapterFactory after starting j2ee server and
		it worked.
	3)  Now need to substitute an actual LDAP server and move this stuff
		into the portlet code.


---20020815

	1)  Created TestUserFacade to test UserFacade.  UserFacade uses JspFramework
		to get the PageGroups.  The pageGroups should have
		The pages in the groups as elements.
		Return Vector of pagegroups from which pages can be obtained.
		*** TODO *** add getPages to PageGroup, addPage, removePage.
		****DONE *** 2002-08-16


---20020816

	1)TestUserFacade method testGetMenus(userId) creates

	Menus for woo
        Place: Maintain
                Has Pages:
                        Roles
                        PersonalFacade
        Place: Home
                Has Pages:
                        Home
                        ToDo
        Place: User Info
                Has Pages:
                        Create User
                        People
                        ViewUsers
                        PersonalFacade

	Thus getMenus(userId) returns a vector of PageGroups objects.  Each page
	group can be asked for the pages it contains.  The page contains information
	about jsp, etc.

	The set of page groups returned depends upon the UserGroups the userId belongs
	to, e.g. Owner, SysAdmin, etc.  Pages, groups, etc. and their relationships
	are defined in config/page-config.xml


---20020820

	1) Moved Facades to JspFramework
	2) Changed build.xml's to reflect this.
	3) Also moved TestUserFacade to JspFramework
	4) Fixed run to do run tests.TestUserFacade
	5) Created jar in DataObjectGenerator with data objects
	6) Created jsps in web.  This currently is adpTab jsps
		a)  Need to convert header.jsp to be a jsp that
			gets the UserFacade bean and lays out the top tabs.
			for a chosed place.  Clicking the tab
			launches the pages jsp.
		b)  Create the left.jsp to so similarly for laying out
			the places.  Clicking on a place chages the header.jsp
			to different tabs for new place.
	7) Create dummy jsps for testing above as per page-config.xml
	8) Try to make it so we have two different styles, main-tabs and
		main-tree.  Then login determines.

	9) **TODO** Convert the header.jsp.
	10) **TODO** Convert the header.html and others so that they use the user facade.


---20020829

	1) Meeting with Group.
		a)  Assign Greg, et. al. to work on field validations.
			tags and references to javaScript validations.
		b)  My charge # for SE 99 Design is QVPV per Mike Preis.
		c)  Dan is creating paging function, wrapper will need
			a getURL(int pageNum) or such.


---20020902

	1) Xfer UserPreferencesImpl and UserPreferences and tests to woo-vaio from
		Wonderland.  Make this a JavaBean to itself.
	2) Start creating BusinessProcesses, Jobs, Tasks, and Scheduler.
		a)  Create EmployeeReview BusinessProcess and ScheduleReviews Process
			i)  Given a selected employee, schedule their next review
				with options for recurring, escalation, etc.
			ii) The EmployeeReview BP then upon being activated by
				the TaskScheduler brings up EmployeeReviewInput
				queues to supervisor and 3 peers for comment.
			iii) Input by Supervisor after receiving 3 peers, back to
				employee for comment.
			iv)  Then back to Supervisor for "grading", copy of grade
				to SalaryReview and requeue EmployeeReview for next
				time.
		b) ScheduleReviews brings up list of employees, provides selection and
			hands to Scheduler to set parameters.
		c) NewHire Process would create initial expectations part of review
			copy to employee, and queue to supervisor for scheduling.
	3) Separate out XML part of TableWrapper as wrapping delegate?  Add interface
		methods to be able to use if data is from a result set.  i.e. the tearing down and building the "model" is encapsulated and can be selected by specifying which delegate to use, e.g. "result-set" or
		"xml".  This cause creating of instance to parse and set variables
		in TableWrapper.  Xfer to woo-vaio from Wonderland with tests.
	4) Create jsps for EmployeeSelection, Scheduler, EmployeeReview screen. Test.
	5) BusinessProcess are collections of Screens with navigation and roles.
	6) Roles must be selected from Roles where parents are people which have
		userIds.
	7) Scheduler "might" really be the "creator" of Business Processes?
		a)  Start with screen, specify the parameter name?, bp name?
		b)  Give precedence screen(s), roles for screen, whether queued?
		c)  Show routing view of bp so far? as you create?
		d)  Save the bp.
	8) A Job consists of assigning a set of bps in a sequence with beginning item
		such as the selected employee or item.
	9) Tasks are the queue entries?  Start date, assignedTo, screen, item, ...
	10) A Job becomes a series of Tasks.  The job is completed when
		the "end-state" is reached.
		a)  So, we have active jobs, the "next" task under that job,
			the individual or role assigned to service that task, ...
		b)  Users normally don't see jobs.  They see tasks in their queues.
		c)  Managers can look at jobs in the system.
		d)  What are the attributes of a job? a task?
		e)  A business process is a "template" that is used by a job, each
			piece becomes a task.  BusinessProcesses can themselves be
			a part of a larger Job.
   	11) USE Taglib for all screen input, etc.


---20020909

	1)  Added project Development/Projects/struts/struts-digester
		a)  Uses Digester class from struts to parse the page-config.xml
			file a LOT easier than before.
		b)  Look at TestDigester to see the parsing.
		c)  Replace the other configs parsers with this.
		d)  Is there a way to have this configurable also?


---20020910

	1)  Gartner group (2002)
		a)  180 billion lines of COBOL code currently exist
		b)  We estimate, 100 billion lines of COBOL in the U.S.
		c)  50 billion lines need to be replaced over the next 20 years.
		d)  With 5:1 compression
		e)  It will cost $500 billion to replace these systems
		f)  The applications are not so different that core components can�t be shared

	2)  Backed up Clearcase, f_drive, weblogic, and weblogic_applications
		on 1 CD.
	3)  Backed up MyDocuments/Downloads, TOPLink Builder, Quicken
		several zips off of C on second CD.
	4)  Clean up downloads, etc.
	5)  Backup Visual Age and repository, then delete
	6)  Check Forte and Forte4J


---20020911

	1)  Changed JspFramework to use new Digester in UserFacade rather than
		the old hand built parsers.
	2)  Changed JspFramework so that config has new config files for Digester.
	3)  Tested putting jsp page that had tags in for viewUsers.
	4)  For some reason run tests.TestUserFacade works fine, BUT
	 	run junit.swingui.TestRunner looks like it's reading old code
	 	when it runs it's tests.  It has problems with class loader
	 	getting the HandlerBase.  Seems to be duplicate classes in jar files
	 	used by DataObjectGenerator jar and perhaps the JspFramework
	5)  We need to determine just how to build a jsp and wire it in useing
		struts. ** TODO **

		        </Context>

	2)  /producer takes us to d:/web_applications/producer.
		a)  There we find web-inf/web.xml
			   <servlet-mapping>
			              <servlet-name>Logon</servlet-name>
			              <url-pattern>logon</url-pattern>

			   </servlet>

		*** This seems to be taking us to solution designer.

	3)  		  	<Context path="/Producer"
		                 docBase="d:/web_applications/sc_producer"
		                 crossContext="false"

  		a)  Which brings us to d:/web_applications/sc_producer/web-inf/web.xml

This should take us to file:///d:/Projects/sc_producer/conf/ContactManager/ContactManagerRuntime.xml which
is loaded by StartupServlet.java

StartupServlet gets initparameter

"projectpropertiesurl"

which is the above file.

It hands this to

      URL url = new URL(above String);
      ApplicationContainable container = getFactory().newApplication(url);

      getFactory creates a new ApplicationFactory();


---20020917

	1)  Drop 4 will have Bonds and Account Compliance as portlets
		a)  They should have some selectivity component, i.e.
			a "build a query" form to get various selections.
	2)  Drop 6 will have Account Management and Create Account
		a)  Don't know how we'll handle work flow involved here.
		b)  We're to design form input and handling.
			i)  error tag
			ii) ErrorBean
			iii) Validator interface, Validator Service
				returns string array of error message numbers and arguments.  Wrapper puts them into ErrorBean.
			iv)  If exception thrown on eaiAdapter, message is
				wrapped as ErrorBean unless timeout exception
		c)  Got to look at how to do form navigation.  Struts or internal?
	3)  Drop 8 will have Account Profile and permissions.
		a)  Develop navigation portlet that couples to view portlet.
			As various things in nav portlet are selected, the
				details show in view portlet.
			I think view portlet can use the prototype pattern.

	4) *** In development/projects/producer apparently not getting
		datasource name and driver?  Still setup information.

	1)  Recreated from StarTeam SC_Framework and Producer to be renamed to SC_Producer
	2)  They appear to have proper xml.
	3)  Copied template build.xml into both.
	4)  *** TODO *** Update the build.xml carefully to create jars and wars
		and put in proper places.
	5)  Test.


---20021002

	1)  Finished the build.xml files and they both compile correctly.
	2)  Changed e: to d: in Producer.xml, ContactManager.xml, and the
		ApplicationFactory main method.
	3)  Created TestParser when parser couldn't find the file.  TestParser
		trys and then tests via the File aFile = new File(fileName),
			followed by the aFile.exists() method which returns true.
	4)  Mailed results to Tim.
	5)  Still trying to figure out what went wrong.
	6)  Replaced Xerces.jar with Tim's and the test works.  However
		the Tomcat doesn't.  Appears it is using a different xerces?


---20021008

	1)  Capture no userid and send to login error page.
