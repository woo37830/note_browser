When we copy a node and paste it, we update the genericId so that it is consistent and unique.
When we cut and paste it, we don't do that.

Command line java -version and Eclipse java vms all point to /user/libexec/java_home which
points to:
ls -al /usr/bin/java
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  74 Feb 10 14:10 /usr/bin/java@ 
   -> /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java
BUT, .app bundles use Apple's JavaApplicationStub and use Apple Java 6
from /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/bin/java
FOR SOME REASON, Eclipse and command line expect -Xms1500m for Archiver
but .app expects it to be -Xmx1500m!

Discovered where the files are in the JFileChooser if you found the 
visible Dialog that contains the list of files.
   Component[] level0 = aDialog.getComponents();
   JRootPane rpane = ( JRootPane ) level0[0];
   Component[] level1 = rpane.getComponents();
   JLayeredPane lpane = ( JLayeredPane ) level1[1];
   Component[] level3 = lpane.getComponents();
   JPanel jpanel = ( JPanel ) level3[0];
   Component[] level4 = jpanel.getComponents();
   JFileChooser chooser = ( JFileChooser ) level4[0];
        File[] files = chooser.getFileSystemView().getFiles(
                         chooser.getCurrentDirectory(), false );
        System.out.println( "Files: " + prtFiles( files ) );
        chooser.setSelectedFile( getFileNamed(value) );

Problem with Merge is that I need to find the node's id that is either
in memory or the archiver.  I also need the branchId from the root
of each of memory and archiver.  I can't locate the node in the archiver
because, for some reason, the root wasn't set in MajorMinorOrderedMap
when it was constructed from the archvier data.

---20150513 20:49:05
Got merge to work!  Clean up panels, etc.

---20150603 14:57:59
Refactored processFile into loadData and processData
Created a Duration Object so that it would contain start and end dates
checked for order, then methods to see if a candidate Duration
intersects a Duration.  By comparing a candidate to a list
of existing Durations, we can tell if this one is to be pre-pended,
appended, or inserted.  Saved workspace on External_256G.  Still have problem
with progress bar.

Installed Steam and link to Firefly Online portal.
Found that .bash_profile need the sourcing of alias near the beginning
and that in the .bashrc there are somehow aliases like ls, l la, that
cause a problem.  Commented them out.  Later in the aliases they seem to be okay.
Will make sure I put them in there.  Probably a case of double
assigning them, ls got defined as ls -1, then used as l = ls ???
