	1) checked pcpi functioning.  Need to follow quick calc path from printout back t start.
	2) checked wfeditor and found it to be working for typed in xml.  May
		generate when changes are made.  Check this.
	3) wrote db to xml writer for pcpi db.  Need to make this spit out
		xml that wfeditor can read or make it able to read
		the state machine type input.
		should it also output in format that matches current sc_workflow?
	4) look into reading in statemodel in pcpi from xml generated as above.
	5) sc_messaging seems to need more information on how to start j2ee and 
		set up the queues and topics. *** look up this ***
			*** DONE 4/29/2004 See README.txt in sc_messaging ***
	

---20040206
	1) Dumping pcpi db workflow to an application file "pcpi.xml" and actionLibrary,
		"pcpiActionLibrary.xml", and a set of files for each process.
	2) Can now read the above files back into memory forming States and Actions.
		*** Can't reconstitue the delegate actions as they are not the right
			class.  Will need to map them back to the proper shoulders
			classes. ***
	3) Need to add descriptions in the database for each of the processes.
		*** TODO ***, then regen.
	4) See if I can map the xml here into the xml required by the wf_editor OR
		have it read this format as an option.  Maybe xslt?
		*** TODO ***

---20040208
	1) Changed loading in WorkflowToXML to read in the class of the Writer from
		the config.ini file.
	2) Writer is an interface that StateMachineWorkFlowWriter implements.
	3) This writes out a file in the style that the state machine would use.
	4) *** Now create a SCWorkFlowWriter to write it out so that the
		editor can read it.
	5) *** Create the reader to read in the SC workflow ( just like the one in WFEditor, hopefully, and read it in.
	6) *** provide a class provided through the configuration to do the access
		to the work flow.  It would be responsible for initially reading it
		in and setting the class into the Services Registry.
		frmo there we would get the WorkFlowAccess class and from it get the data.
	7) *** Implement the WorkFlowAccess interface and the DBWorkFlowAccess implementation.  The DBWorkFlowAccess implementation would work as now.
		Methods would do (WorkFlowAccess)registry.get("WorkFlowAccess").getXXX.
		

---20040210
	1)  Installed coLinux and downloaded fortune and got it working.  paths etc.
		still need setting in .cshrc.
	2)  Need to get an X server installed.
	3)  TransformWorkFlow needs needs to move the action gathering logic from
		the Writer to the Reader. *** TODO ***
	4)  Need to write out XML file for PCPI. create reader to read it.
	

---20040211
	1)  Need to add workcenters to work flow writers.
		Add a work center to the statemodel as a parameter.
		Add the initiating actor role also.
	2)  When I read back in the stateModel, can I "map" it into the SC workflow or
		pcpi workflow objects.  Need a mapper for each of these.
	 	*** How to map a State and Action to an Activity with a delegate or
	 		AutomatedActivity?
		Then see what is missing when I reconstitute.
	3)  WorkFlowAccess then becomes a reader, and a mapper, exposing methods
		for the different applications.
	4)  Downloaded tex, latex, csh, pforth, to coLinux.
	5)  ftp'd my .cshrc over.  Need to improve it.
	6)  Still looking for a "Debian" desktop.
	

---20040223
	1)  Need to write out workcenters as parms on business processes
		perhaps initiating actor-role as well
	2)  New Hire is wrong.  the checkSSN should be an action during the transition
		it should be a if then else action, As should all automated activities.
		successful, it goes to add Payroll Agreement
			unsuccessful goes to list multiple PA, etc.
	

---20040329
	1)  PCPI QuickCalc Documentation
		a)  webApplication/WEB-INF/web.xml
    <servlet>
      <servlet-name>qcdemo</servlet-name>
      <servlet-class>com.adp.pcpi.quickcalc.QCController</servlet-class>

	    compOut = callProcessor.QuickCalcProcess(compIn);
	
	    QuickCalcCompanyOutput.QCCompany recCo = compOut.company;
 	---------------------------------------------------------------
 	
  	2)  Create testQuickCalc that creates pcpiCodeHelper,
  		abstracts getInputFromScreen to getInputFromEnvironment? or
  			creates a getInputFromFile( for testing )
  		and writes output to a file for viewing.
  		*** DONE *** Added button to batch status to view checks. Using
  		paybatch as data.  


---20040417

	1)  PCPI todo:
		a)  ESS Load, create utility to create a schedule from web page.
		b)  YTD Load, create utility ...
		c)  Fix load progress bar.
		d)  Create utility for managing Queue.
		e)  Create Archiver interface. 
			i)  Add getArchiver(class) to later replace getTopLinkGateway().
			ii) lazy init to load DEFAULT class (toplinkGateway) from config.
			iii) others class archivers from there also.
			iv) Extract interface from ToplinkGateway to use.
			v) Test using only default.
			vi) Create xml gateway that will load the workflow on startup, like XferWorkflow.
			vii) see if we can get the processes, etc. using that gateway.  Be sure that workflow is stored in appropriate environment.
			viii) check to put rules into same "org" environment.  Key is
				coCode for now.
		f)  Where are EmployeeSelfService Screens?
		g)  Check create pay file. Fix if necessary.
		h)  Check checks printed.  Verify amounts are correct.  Add to tables
			if necessary.
		i)  Finish Standard archiver and begin to substitute for TopLink.
			a) Create tests!!!!
			b) Create interface for each referenced TOPLink class ( see sc_ )
			c) Create implementation TL_xxx that extends xxx and implements interface.  Put these into another project, ToplinkAdapters.
			d) Test the implementations using a test project for TL_Adapters.
			e) Replace one reference to getTLGateway() with getArchiver() 
				which returns TL_Gateway which implements Archiver.
				Have it save and read an object.
			f) Make getArchiver get its configuration from config using
				TLGateway as default when no class specified or archiver not found in archiver table by className.
				archiver table is on an application basis.
			g) Test reading in workflows and rules using Archiver?
		


---20040504

	1)  In QueueManager folder, README.txt provides a note about using createDB.sql
		to create an AIM database using MySQL.  I should do this and test it by changing the url in my sc_tests suite.  Would be nice to have queues working in mySQL.  Then consider extracting table data from existing
		Access sc_tests database and recreating in MySQL.
			*** TODO ***
	2)  Create WAR file from sc_wfserver_http, deploy and test.
		a)  Create simple jsps for two applications simple and complex.
		b)  Create a "home" page that provides selecting application
			and building the process dropdowns.
			Clicking a process in the dropdowns starts that process.
			Provide a table of queue entries on home page.
			clicking an entry dequeues that applicaition/process
			and replaces the screen with it.  Default of no next
			state is to return to default home page.
	3)  Extend the sc_tests and pcpi_tests.
	

---20040826

	1)  How to persist embedded objects without using proxy?
	2)  Test model, minuit, and other ported apps.
	3)  Install gnugo, ghostview, test tex, latex, etc.
	4)  Look into adding stats for users, etc.
	5)  Recover the proxy codes, but don't add persistence inside the codes.  The object graph will cause those to persist.
	6)  How do we clean up the classcast problems with those.  Apparently have to use interfaces more carefully.
	7)  Maybe look at hibernate to see how it manages proxy behavior without adding them to the code.


---20040901
	
	1)  Investigate null pointer on DemoBatch.  Fix. *** DONE in jsp ***
	2)  Investigate reason for no Active entries in pcpi, suspect added code *** WRONG, bad data,
			changed back to original version of dtabase 5,420KB and queueing works!
		to suppress in RoleBasedQP or servlet.  If fixed will have to 
		add button to screens that have no "Done" button, so queue can
		be cleaned up.  FIX.  *** NOTE - Entries are being marked complete as soon as created.
		i)  Found that skipsQueueing in 1:2213 was false.  Also test was not committing.
		ii) After changing started getting error on buildscreen that PayBatch.xml was missing?
	3)  Add Done button to PrintChecks.jsp to return to home page.  Use code
		from the home button.  Fix. *** DONE in jsp using link
	4)  Examine how to use Task in PerformanceReview.  Is there a way to use it
		in the Queueing itself?  TaskBasedQueueingPolicy?  
	5)  Investigate payroll schedule.  How to get to load.  Fix.
	6)  Investigate adding attributes to distinguish template from instance to
		Entity.  A template acts like a class.  It is a pattern for creating
		instances.  another attribute would be the parentTemplate?  like the
		super class.
		a)  A process could create a template.  choose from parents.
		b)  name the template.  Add attributes to the template.
		c)  Another process or step would be to create an instance.
		d)  Choose the template, get a list of instances?  add, remove, edit.
		e)  This would be used in a demo of creating a "class" on the fly
			then several instances of the class.  populating them.
			then have the inspection.jsp show the data.  
			i)  Top has name of class, number of instances.
			ii) below has the first instance, prev, next, add, delete
			iii) At top has real attributes, hr, then dynamic attributes.
	7) Change webapp to sc_app, test.  *** DONE in jsp ***
	8) Change Bug to have proper attributes, extend Task?
	9) Create Note, perhaps extending Task also?
	10) Got model.f to compile and read data a few times.  Now it blows up, perhaps memory?
	11) Send josh an invoice.  Log book is prepared.
			
2004-09-01

	1)  Send josh invoice
	2)  mtg. @ 10:30 on srm see note on desk
	3)  edit jsp's and xml to reflect changes in Bug
	4)  redeploy jars
	5)  Test bug.
	6)  Add attributes to handle passing bug around
	7)  What is the flow?, roles?  how specified.
	8)  need a bug-reviewer, role of bug-fixers, bug-verifier
	9)  user submits, goes to reviewer, selects fixer, fixes, sends to verifier, then back to completed.
	10) screen shows my bugs (active, completed).
	11) add a bug ( does this look at all bugs? ).
	12) is note just a Task?  If no dates, okay, if dates, put them into queues, etc.
	13)  Try this after getting above working.
	14)  Don't forget about schedule loading for pcpi
	

---20040909

	1)  bug and notes still need work.
	2)  got part of Self Service Working.
		a)  Need to add LoginHandler. take input, verify, then put right info into session, forward
		b)  Create SelfServiceUser table, CoCode, SSN, password.  reflect in registration and login
		c)  Add tables for educational history, job history, etc.  links to person via contextOwner?
		d)  Can I use sc_app as a basis?  Create an archiver that uses sql from config via names
			e.g. sql
				salaryHistory=select x from .... where ssn = ? and xxx = ?
				in statemodel, provide parm1 = ssnElement, xxx = xxxElement
		e)  How to handle tables?  Can we create a table tag that uses vectors rather than 
			objects?  i.e. element1 comes from sql as clause, element 2 comes from as clause?
			

---20040911

	1)  Got all pages showing, some as "In progress".   Finish
	2)  Still need to get schedule loading.   Work on this.
	3)  Look for dvi viewer, Jago why not working.
	4)  Where is fwp.tex or what ever so I can see how to do the FlyWrite pages. *****GOT IT***
	5)  Check out tex completely.  *** WORKING WITH DVIVIEW TEX_DOCUMENTATION ***
	6)  Create a backup of complete system.  Try using the PC mover application. *** DONE ***
	

---20040914

	1)  Copy JavaView from work.
	2)  Create JavaDoc for all sc_app packages.
	3)  Make sc_app a Tomcat project like ess.  Believe it's mostly creating the context in tomcat to
		point to the development environment.  
	4)  Get Tomcat plugin and install. ( makes deploying, starting and stopping easier ).
	5)  Add rules to the sc_app to demonstrate their use.
	6)  Do more work on the peer review application.
	7)  Fix the select box on the history page.
	8)  PCPI/ESS --- Create a "Taxes -- request changes" button that leads to edit for taxes
		then submits to PCPI queue.  Page there comes up with old/new and approve/dissapprove.
		How to notify user?  Probably with email.  ( be sure that exists ).
	9)  schedule loading and payroll processing. ******
	10) Where are the javadoc layout pages?
	

---20040921

	1)  Got Test for Performance Review working.
	2)  Complete Notes and Bugs **** TODO ****
	3)  Add Self Service 
		a)  PerformanceReviews - table of history by performance period, select brings up review
			current one can be edited by employee
		b)  If has reports, Direct Reports - list of employees being supervised.
			select brings up tabbed Position, Personal, Emergency, Performance Reviews
		c)  Equipment Assigned - table of equipment
		d)  Expenses - table of expenses ( status - submitted, processed, paid ), create new, submit.
		e)  Time allocated and taken - vacation request, etc.
		f)  Time track, need create client, rate, etc.  Generate report on time each week.
	4)  add workflow for processing expense request and vacation request.
	5)  Under HR add a calendar of scheduled vacations.
	6)  Separate project for QueueManagement, has home, task list, statistics, history, but also
		has a reload that causes the actual QueueManagementDelegate to get reloaded.( to be
			able to tune the escalation and delegation.)  This also monitors queue for 
			escalation, awakening, etc.
	7)  Consider a ResolverAction.  Takes either a route or a routeName and performs the necessary
		query, resolves the element, and places result into result.
		e.g.  ResolverAction, parm1 = User[userId=@1].person.name ... this gets the users name given the id
				      parm2 = userId...  this maps to the @1
				      parm3 = userName ... this is where the persons name goes
	8)  When supervisor is working on a performance Review a supervisor visible button ( history ) shows
		up.  Clicking on it brings up in a separate window the list of previous pr's.  Clicking a particular
		one brings up a separate window with that pr.
	9)  Might use tabs on a PR, viz.  employee info at top, tabs under.
		tabs might be (Traits) (MOP1) (MOP2)...(MOPn)(Summary)...
	10) When completing PR a new one is created by copy and edited.  All PRs are back linked to person.
	11) Add tabs to some screens to test.  On thumb drive
	12) Added stub Personal and Company under SelfService.
	

---20040925

	1)  Worked on Notes, using Task
	2)  Created Enqueue and caused PR to be enqueued.  Check that Result should or should not be set.
	3)  NOW need to add the QueueMonitor Servlet.  checks and forwards, etc.
		it should have a configurable EscalationPolicy.
		Also a simple jsp that allows one to tell it to reload.
		jsp will tell us what is waiting, etc.
			
			

---20040926

	1)  Having problem with restarting things in queues.  Apparently sometimes the queue Name gets set
	to something other than the name of the application.  Like DefaultQueue. This queers
	things up.  I need to get the name of the default application from the config
	instead of making it up.  The config needs to be in the environment and 
	accessible everywhere.  How to do that?  Maybe I've already done it and just
	can't remember.  Check for config, application, etc. and be sure the default
	is always something like bdmc.evaluate("config").getProperty("Defaults", "application", null);
	and if null, blow up nicely.
	
	2)  For admin waiting selection should show the time at which we become active.
	3)  Fixed paging problem.  It was that we needed to render after doing the paging.
	
	

---20040929

	1)  Need to be sure process info is in separate scope rather than session.
		and that each "startProcess" creates a new process scope.
		

---20040930

	1)  JM2GG-WPC8H-2KBFF-7VHJR-7VDRT - key for MS Project.
	2)  Saved V1_5 of sc_app with process scope fixed.
		*** History screen paging does not stay in selected COMPLETED. ***
	3)  Need to move other process variables into process scope.
	4)  Update jsp's in eclipse from deployed app.
	

---20041003

	1)  Got paging working by putting _status into session.  Why is this needed?
	2)  Now that that works, the "Back" button doesn't work. Gives a "Syntax error on page".
	3)  The from doesn't show anyone in the task list.  Why.
	4)  Is there a way to show the Since date better, with a mouse over that shows formatted
		time, etc.?  
	5)  In the History, if waiting, show the time it's waiting for.
	

---20041008

	1)  Downloaded helpgui-1.1.jar
		use this to implement help for pcpi and ess.
		Add this to header.jsp so it will launch.  Then add specific pages.
		put jar into ThirdPartyLibs
	2) 
	

---20041011

	1)  Got things working on Excelliant's machine and sending it back.
	2)  Tried to install copy of Acess2003 and then un-install.  Screwed up regular Access
		and had to reinstall all of that!
	3)  Added access to help files from support center for now.
		Changed file in D:\Development\Projects\pcpi\webApplication\en-us\html\CompanyInfo.htm!
		but referred to jakarta location for help files!  This is handleded by 
		config.ini, I think.  I got it working better on excelliant machine.
		change to use same on this one soon!!!
	4)  Need to figure out how to get context help "I" working.
	5)  Batch servers and loading schedules!!!! *** TODO ***
	6)  employmentHistory.jsp in ess needs to create sql for getting employement
		rows joined to appointments, and display dates, companies, positions, etc.
	7)  Help from page level needs pcpi-help servlet that uses context=xxx to do a mapping
		to the proper page.  Probably get this mapping from config file by getting
		help.map file name and read it in as another config file?
			[BaseDirectory]
				base=x/y/z
			[context]
				fedTaxes=FederalTaxes.htm
				personal=Personal.htm
				....
	8) Servlet then just creates HashMap of contexts with full file names and
		brings them up in separate frame with generic Help button that takes
		user to generic help function with searching.
	9) Support should bring up page that shows help button and web help button.
	

---20041012

	1)  Added tabbed panes for maint and users.
	2)  Bug list throws exception, can't locate class core.Property, probably old bad data.
	3)  PC to Aaron has S/N 28332530 3602518
		Model is : PCG-993L, with RedHat Linux installed
		root password is secret
		ajw password is secret
	4)  pcpi nav panel < and > images don't show up *** TODO ***
	5)  Find doesn't work for last name or SSN, seems to work for file #.  *** TODO ***
	6)  no filters work.  *** TODO ***
	

---20041020

	1)  Put skins into pcpi.
	2)  Now in login, create userProfile session variable and place
		skins.UserProfileBean into it.  Set the default to green_piece or so.
	3)  Have the header.jsp use the code from Personal.jsp to set the logo
		and the background, do the same for navigation, and main frame?
	4)  Add a button at the top for user preferences where one can change the selection
		of styles they want.
		

---20041021

	1)  Have skins working in CompanyInformation.jsp
	2)  Don't have it reading the properties file yet.
	3)  Have the skin changing the todo list colors to show skin change and logo.
	4)  Have help working again.  More work to do here in checking all
		links, removing ADP specific, renaming files to match.
	5)  Skins should also allow changing the gifs, etc. for overall look and feel.
	6)  Should get name of page from servlet parm so we can change out 1 at a time.
		Fixed so that if jsp, then no bind. Use tags instead.
	7)  Need to locate where dequeue and start process are done.  Check first to see
		if we have read in a statemachine for the process.  If so, use it, else
		do old way.  Gradually replace all processes with state machines.
	8)  CAREFULLY cvs pcpi, then merge from webapps back into pcpi and archive.
	9)  Added page level help for dependents.  Note that pcpi reads currently from 
		d:\Development\Projects\pcpi\webApplication\en-us\html and xml
		In config.ini changed to put base of help ( note only for english right now)
		and in each xml file need to put the Help pointing to the directory
		under the help_doc/DIR/file.htm. *** TODO ***
	10)  Be sure to copy conf and other data to the d:\data\pcpi directory
		and reconfigure the web.xml to use that!  *** TODO ***
	11)  Create an ant build file to package for distribution and deployment! *** TODO ***
	

---20041025

	1)  Get the description or code on the Deductions screen
	2)  Put a select box on the left
	3)  Add buttons on the bottom for Add and Edit
	3)  Go to the add Deduction screen with Save ( submits deduction to manager ) and Cancel, back to
		the view.
	4)  Go to the Edit Deduction screen with Edit, show details, have Save, Delete, cancel.
		Save and delete send data to manager in queue, cancel returns to view.
	5)  review deduction change shows manager request.  Approve or dissapprove.
		Approve saves change and sends email to employee.
		Dissapprove throws it away with reason and sends email to employee.
		Both complete work flow.
	6)  How do we determine manager ( for now anyone with mgr role ).
	

---20041026

	1)  ICONS on main page, from Larry.

---20041027

	1)  Create QuickCalcCompanyInput using input data.  See Driver.java
	2)  Create QuickCalcPayInput using input data.
	3)  Create QuickCalcPayInput.QCTaxInfo using QuickCalcPayInput.QCTaxInfo, fill with input data
	4)  repeat ofr each tax, each is added to inputPay
	5)  Create QuickCalcPayInput.QCEarnings and add to inputPay with addEarnings();
	6)  Create any QuickCalcPayInput.QCDeductions and do addDeduction to payInput.
	7)  Add inputPay to inputCompany using addPayInput();
	8)  Create a QuickCalcProcessor

		Use Driver.QuickCalcTestLoad(new QuickCalcCompanyInput()) in 
			client test.
			

---20041028

	1)  Replacing tasklist icons involves merely replacing the jpgs with the same named jpegs
		in the images file.  The names are:
		NavigationBuilder.getTaskListNavigationHtml("StartNewCycle","EnterNewHires","PayEmployees","ConfirmData","SubmitFiles") %>
		each with extension .jpg
		

---20041103

	1)  Why changing skins between login and tasklist?  *** skins.UserProfileBean default, changed to hrwebpay, installed in classes, tested" ***
	2)  Add an edit emergency contact to ess, use page from pcpi
	3)  Need to show example of ess putting something into the queue for pcpi.
	4)  pcpi qcPay service having problems with the deserializer?  Namespaces?
	5)  back on History has problem, is render being called?
	6)  Filter on pcpi not working?
	7)  Fix resetPassword.jsp
	8)  Why doesn't it work correctly if one messes up password?
	9)  reconfig for Cummings
	10)  Delay trying to get deductions into ess.  Need to track that down.
	11)  Do more on the performance review!!
	12)  Try to put the new wf into pcpi so it's called to see if a process or state exists when dequeing
		if it does, then run it from there?  Map the new state to the old state somehow
		and use from there?  Not sure how this would work.
	13)  Describe how there are several ways to use rule-based system to monitor HR compliance.
		a)  401K is updated, then fire rules.
		b)  use WAITING queue status to place job into queue that is triggered
			to run compliance report periodicallly, filter the output,
			send results to directed roles.
		        Describe how this could be set up in configuration file per company.
		        [Periodic Checks]	
		        	401K=nameOfProcess,frequency,starting when
		        	IRCA_Compliance=nameOfProcess, frequency, starting when
		        	...
		        	process contains roles, actions such as email etc.
		        	

---20041113

	1)  Refactor way that applications are stored so that each is "independent" and
		can be installed.  HR is in a folder HR under applications under contect
		root.  jsps are there, work flows, maybe elements?, 
	2)  Each application is a separate project with minimum for that.  No knowledge
		of other projects or applications.
	3)  Add the reset jsp and validate jsp.  make it only two pages.  Enter
		coCode, userid, and new password.  Then after verify account exists
		do popip alert box to get authorization "4.Renew", then update
		password after getting via alert a verification of new password.
		        	

---20041115

	1)  Refactored pcpi into:
	
		pcpi-common
			payCalcAPI
				payCalc
					pcpi
	2)  This was so that a web service of pcpi-common, payCalcAPI, and payCalc could
		be deployed.
	3)  Present version of webapps in Tomcat uses the conf.ini in development
		and the templates from there also, but the jsps from the Tomcat dir.
	4)  Carefully back these up,  change web.xml and config.ini
		to point to proper place in d:\data.  Don't have duplicates
	5)  Create Ant script to move data from pcpi to d:\data and Tomcat\webapps
		as deploy, another as packageDemo, be sure what is in pcpi deploy? is
		the stuff that gets moved to the proper places.
	6)  Create new hrpay that test using this.
	
	7)  Redo organization of sc_app so that we have applications/application/jsp, etc.

	1)  Today, fill out expense sheet. Remember taxi fares!  Submit.   *** DONE ***
	2)  Pay CC bill, mail  *** DONE ***
	3)  Take an airplane ad to Manassas, post 1 up, 1 down.   *** DONE ***
	4)  put pcpi into cvs.  Remember to reorganize data.
	5)  look at sc_app refactoring also.  Each app is separate project, hr, maint, etc.
	6)  Create test of new pcpi and see how it goes. Is persistence screwed up?
	7)  Ant scripts for sure!!
	8)  Look at axis again using the new payCalcAPI, etc.  Test whether we
		can get the answer back as a custom object, then can we send one.
		*** NEED TO CHANGE Lists to Arrays ***
	9)  CVS setup is:
		Connection Type: pserver
		User: woo
		Host: localhost
		Port: default
		Path: d:/cygwin/usr/local/cvsroot
		
	10)  Backup sc_app in webapps, then copy jsps and elem.xmls to eclipse, then 
		cvs.  Create deploy script.
		

---20041117

	1)  Complete items from earlier
	2)  Test the UNZIP.exe to deploy HRWebPay
	3)  Change the sc_app to use a getJspPath(env, jspName), which could load a JspPathConfigurator
		from config that uses the data in env like dept, etc. to determine
		the path.
	4)  Where are the rules stored?  What scope?  Several?  Look in most restrictive
		first, etc.?  *** TODO ***
	5)  Examine JPF to see how they do things!
		a)  installed jpf-demo in Xfer/downloads/plugins
		b)  it works.
		c)  Examine how it works.  This is a nice way to have configurable UI's?
	6)  UNZIP.EXE scripts, etc. located in c:\Program Files\NSIS\Contrib\Self-Extractor
	7)  Finish adding rest of pcpi files to extract script.  Set to be hrwebpay as name.
		Be sure web.xml, config.ini, etc. all agree.  Deploy to tomcat as hrwebpay and test
		 We would select the directory as d:\ and see if it works!

	1)  Met with Robert and Charles Wilson.  Got the FAR database also.  Robert will look
		at doing a scan of a folder of files, putting suspect into Suspect folder, others
		into clear folder.  Also he will look at doing a load from clear, confidential, secret 
		folders to build initial dictionary, with ability then to remove from dictionary.
		Charles will send me a list of proper questions.  We will think about how to do the
		case of this is confidential, but john can see it.  *** TODO *** Create Redact.exe
		that will unzip everything for demos.
	2)  Go back to the order example for the axis service.  See if Eclipse can build a web-service
		through a plugin.   *** TODO ***
	3)  Refactor out the pcpi-base with just data access, basics so that payCalc compiles without
		anything to do with hr or payroll.  Test then the various parts a la Order.  Probably
		have to replace lists with arrays to get working.  *** TODO ***
	4)  Test the new refactorization of pcpi.  Move stuff into deploy, webApplication, etc. so that
		the installer can build the HRWebPayInstall.exe file.
		

---20041122
	
	1)  Copied down to Development/Projects/TaxTables the dlls, etc.  Tested and got to work, sort-of.
	2)  Need to see how to use as a web-service.
	3)  Need to change the current pcpi payCalc to use arrays and try again.


---20041123

	1)  Make sc_wfeditor work.  Make it work with xml files.  Make it write them out.
	2)  Check out sc_validator?
	3)  Create a demo of new workflow, show generic screens, add routing data, add to screens
		add rule, etc.
		
	4)  Drools, Java rule engine.  drools.org

---20041129

	1) Got smeditor working, need to recreate jar for run.bat.
	2) Check into not using two "dots" and instead go from edge, but color line red if failure.
	3) Have connections switch if line crosses area.
	4) What about other 'tabs'.
	5) Work on the performance review jsp next. *** TODO ***
	6) Update redact data from Charles email.
	


---20041130
	
	1) Create Network for managing networks of objects.  
	2) Used Network in sc_wfeditor to create TreeLayout
	3) Added swapApplication to sc_wfeditor and Layout menu item.
	4) Does decent layout now.
	5) Look up smeditorX to see if there is some stuff on ActionLibrary
	6) Work on payCalc service!!!! *** TODO ***  ***Got this isolated and tested, but not as service.  still problem.  try news groups and email for advice.
	7) Fix Bugs so that Bug is an object that is used by the Queue.  Don't recreate
		queue behavior, since routing bugs around is what it's about.
	8) Fix saving, etc. for sc_wfeditor.  Get parms from States, Transitions
	9) Write out xml.  See if I can use stuff from smeditor. 
	10) Updated Schedule and perform review.xml files.  Reviewed via editors and ran in sc_app.
	11) Traits shows up in list under HR/Traits, Bugs blows up, apparently used Property.  See what happened.
	12) Note that Bugs should just create a Bug Object and enqueue it.  Entire process is just routing and changing toWhom, adding data and comments.
	13)  Prepared a document listing what is needed and resources to accomplish.  Read and revise.
	14)  Check out pay schedule to see why not showing up!!  *** TODO ***
	

---20041204

	1)  Inspect an entry shows up in separate window, needs to replace tabbed pane.
	2)  Adding a bug seems to just update the last one unless there was no last one.
	3)  Notes doesn't show values in object.
	4)  Inspect needs to show queueEntry with ability to edit queuedTo, perhaps by button "Requeue" giving a popup?
		Also change status from WAITING to ACTIVE, Maybe to COMPLETED?
		Requeue should be a requeue not an update, and should select roles and users.
	5)  When returning from SystemAdmin/Maint especially, the list of processes doesn't show up under the SystemAdmin app.
	6)  The done button in Maint doesn't exit and take one back to the tasklist!  Strange interaction when using tabbedPanel.
	

---20041205

	1)  Check out AddPayrollScheduleToPGTest in pcpi-tests
		It appears that a PayrollScheduleYear must be created, with several PayrollSchedules attached.  They
		seem to become children of a PayrollScheduleQueue.  Apparently, a given payrollSchedule is then queued?
		After that one can locate a payroll schedule for a date.
		

---20041207

	1)  Context help for pcpi
	2)  Additional editing to add and use more skins
	3)  Different look and feel for non payroll specific application a la Palm Ventures.
	4)  Documentation ( both for pcpi and sc_app )
	5)  Reconfigure sc_app application layout to try
	
		sc_app/
			WEB-INF/
				/classes
				/lib
				/applications
					/HR
						/ScheduleReview ( one business process specified by state model )
							sm.xml ( state model )
							actionLibrary.xml ( actionLibrary )
							elements/
								elements.xml
								others.xml ( other included elements files )
							images/
							jsp/
		
	6)  Can I write a container reader that knows this structure
		and which other loaders go to to get paths? i.e. 
			getStateModelPath(application, statemodelName)
			getActionLibraryPath(...)
			getElementsPath(...)
			getJspPath(...)
			getApplicationPath(application)
			...
		Make this an interface and put into common?  PathProvider?
			It is configured from config?  At least which PathProvider to use.
			DefaultProvider implements PathProvider and does what it does now?
			ApplicationProvider implements PathProvider?
				under common.reference?
	7)  List the available HR processes and screens.
	8)  Create a Template class in core.  It has a create method for creating
		a new Template.  The create method takes a packagename.classname.
		Templates tell the name of the "class" and specify
		attributes or fields ( name, type, value, properties ) that
		the new class has when created.  A Template has a method 
		create that creates an "instance" of Entity? with the fields as determined
		by the Template.  Fields are accessed by get(fieldName) and set(...?)
		This is provided so that a new Template W4 could be created
		from a screen, fields added, then using an action createTemplateInstance?
		we could create an instance of the W4 and attach it to an Appointment?
		How do we handle children?  I.e. I need to keep a history of W4's.
	9)  Create a NewHire process for my HR application.
		Personal Information
		Recruitment Information
		Employment Information 
		Appointment Information
		Job Position ( Job title/Department )
		Payroll Information
			W4 Information/1099 Information ( fed/state/local jurisdictional )
			Benefits Information
			Deductions Information ( 401K, etc. )
			
		Check that after filling in all of this, the data exists for a correct payCheck.
	10)  Try to use the TaxTable dlls as a service.  How to do one check, and 
		several.  Can I extract the information to and from xml?
	11)  Continue on the payCalc service.  What is happening there?
	12)  Look up the newest version of the 3D viewer to see if I can click
		and link to a url.
	
		

---20041208

	1)  wf_editor 
		a)  Add a Help section with about
		b)  Add to Help, a Notes section that reads "notes" from a file under
			config ( or use notes from database?)
		c)  Add to Help a bugs section, similarly.
		d)  Finish save by writing out files.
		e)  Can I read in a process (written out from pcpi using wf2xml)
			and edit it, adding it to an application.
		f)  Create new application
		g)  Create new process within current application.
		h)  popUp for propertyEditor, delete?
		i)  How to edit, view actionLibrary?
		j)  right mouse in open area for adding State, or Transition?
	2)  pcpi paycalc
		a)  Most of dependency on pcpi-common is in QuickCalcPayInput
			getting things that could be input parameters more directly
			Create new class in pcpi that moves from pa etc. into QuickCalcPayInput
			
			Other dependency is on Configuration, and a few "base" classes.
			that could be moved into pcpi-base which would be smaller
			package.
			

---20041214

	1)  wf_editor
		a)  Able to write out the stateModel, but not the actionLibrary now.
			*** TODO *** need to check in fileName for existing xml from file dialogue before saving.
			Also need to check that saveAs and save work from the File menu.
		b)  Check on the properties for Transitions.  Not being written out right now. *** TODO ***
		c)  Viewing of Transitions shows nothing really.  Should show meta data, description, etc. if there.

Eastern using WebEx.  I monitored using apple in study
		and performance was great.  Assume that signal had to go from PC uplink
		to server, then back down to Apple.  Other end reported VERY slow refresh
		rates, and also some weird aspect ratios.  They were useing some kind
		of wide screen monitor.
	2)  Appeared that marketing to that group was mixed up.  They did not understand
		the idea of selling a service to create workflows, etc.  Wanted a shrink-wrapped
		package that had a lot of HR flows already in it.
		*** TODO *** Should we begin to create a bunch of such flows?
	3)  Still haven't fixed the Bugs and Notes and Traits thing about overwritting
		when you add a new one. *** TODO ***
	4)  Got the Simulation working somewhat, saving a simulation file.  Need to
		work on the graphical display, have it in a separate thread perhaps.
		*** TODO ***
	5)  Still need to do a create payroll and start new cycle.
		Perhaps without a schedule, deductions don't work?
		*** TODO *** Work on deductions, start new cycle, and schedule!!!
