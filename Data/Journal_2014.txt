Downloaded Workless, a framework for rapid creation of web pages.
Made a hard link to .diary and put it into ~/Dropbox/Personal/Documents/Notes

---20140101 21:40:37
It appears to work and thus should be searchable and available
from my iPhone.

---20140103 21:28:10
Commented out references to icalBuddy in ~/bin/geekscripts/main.bash and tommorrow.bash
renamed /user/local/bin/icalBuddy to icalBuddy.bak
Quit Found.app and made it not start at login.  It was causing
numerous logging errors.  Will uninstall if not needed.

Installed teco in Utilities/teco.  Alias teco points to executable there.
Backing it up to backups as tar.gz file.

Tested starting ~/Development/Applications/jira-standalone.
Downloaded fisheye and created FisheyeUser and /usr/local/fisheye
then installed fisheye zip into FishEyeUser directory and set
.profile FISHEYE_INST to point to /usr/local/fisheye ( chmoded to let
fisheyeuser own it ( user password is random1 ).
Started fisheye from it's bin directory start.sh and set admin password
to random1.  Then added woo as a user with password random1
Then "linked" fisheye to jira giving url as http://woo-laptop.local:8060
and userid as woo and password as randome.  Added project sc_demo with key demo
somehow it knows about sc_authenticate, etc.  added an issue.
Not sure how this relates to the cvs directory.

---20140105 18:44:17
created queueAdmin.jsp which is a duplicate of home.jsp.
QueueEntries.xml now directs to this when you select Queue Manamagement
I need to alter the queue.jsp which is a duplicate of tasklist.jsp
to provide for showing the queue entries and having ways to select them
and delete them or reassign them through actions.
This should probably NOT be a queued action, so I'll take that part out
by adding a flag in the process of isQueued false default is true.

---20140107 21:08:01
nextdb_new is now a XCode project.
I had to remove a bunch of externs for dbinfo and test_info
I think that is causing a memory error.
To create the executable, do an Archive
then click on the archived file, show in finder, then select show contents
navigate down until you find the nextdb executable and copy it
to /usr/local/bin
Now it executes, but gets a memory error, because I believe
the dbinfo and tst_info aren't being shared.

Meeting with Jerry and Bill and Chris on Moderate Sedation
Deal with duplicates and "view", If a vendor has a dropdown list
A different use is for a specific sedation.  Anesthesia is reponsible, but 
non-Anesthesists do it.
May need ability to "hide" elements in a view.
in VA click on insert Epidural
Questions on managing common terms that appear in multiple maps.
The problem is that we are trying to do this as a categorization that
depends upon the root nodes, etc. instead of an ontology.

---20140110 15:35:42
Tagged V_1_27 with a pre_view tag before staring to correct view logic.
We added a consistence check for duplicate genericIds.

---20140116 16:34:40
Wrote AdHocExcelReader and SelectColumnDialog to
provide a quick way to read in an ad hoc spreadsheet and output
a tree in xml form.
In configuration ( Eclipse ), the input xls file is first
Sheet name is second, followed by optional output file name for tree.
Ran it against spreadsheet Chris sent and it seemed to run fine.
Used capabilities of the Tree class instead of externally handling
levels, etc. Wrote 447 SLOC that worked!

---20140116 16:38:54
Committed the handling of views.  It will now read in nodes from another 
map and add them to the view on checkout, BUT they are connected
to the wrong parent!  Possibly the lookup is faulty as the id of the node
in the child map is being used, but all external nodes added
should HAVE to be added to a grouping node!

---20140120 12:31:00
All of my movies are in Barsoom on iTunes Drive as Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Movies in folders.
Each folder has an mp4, m4v or other formatted movie.
I've also copied them to a folder on Barsoom desktop called MyMovies.
I'm copying that folder to this laptop (Wooten-laptop) and will put int
my Movies folder and import into iTunes.  They are apparently in the
Shared movie folder on Barsoom.

---20140121 09:51:50
Completed letter to DOE on royalties and response back about closing of contract
with Mike Uzzle.

---20140121 16:37:56
Movies now contains all movies from iTunes backup on barsoom.
Haven't imported all into iTunes on laptop yet.
Turned off LDAP on barsoom to stop key errors caused by expired certificates.
Fixed, I think, the @reboot problem by sourcing .bash_profile from
bin/start_tomcat.
Need to fix it so that if tomcat goes down, it restarts.  Call in to Happy Mac.
Still some problems with the grouping nodes.  Creating some
child ids that aren't pointing to any parents.
MyMovies.zip needs to be copied locally.

---20140124 16:35:43
vim launchd_wrapper.sh   # launchd wrapper 
sudo cp launchd_wrapper.sh /Library/Tomcat/bin
vim org.apache.tomcat.plist  # daemon for launchd
sudo cp org.apache.tomcat.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
vim ~/bin/tomcat # tomcat start/stop/restart        
Still need to create a crontab job that looks for:
ps -ax 
 grep /Tomcat/bin/launchd_wrapper.sh # gets line if there
If it is there ( how to test ? ), then okay
If it is not then ~woo/bin/tomcat start should start it.

---20140128 10:47:54
Worked with Ken at HappyMac to fix problem of dmehelp.com not
redirecting to jwooten37830.com:8080.
He changed it so that in the file where the dmehelp.com files
are in the Server app, he put an index.html with
a piece of meta-data that redirects to http://dmehelp.com:8080
this fixed it.  Use for askjane and others!
Also, replaced the crontab @reboot with a set of files I tested on
my laptop and ftp'd into ~/ftp.  A launchd_wrapper.sh was then
copied to /Library/Tomcat/bin along with a do-nothing setenv.sh
The launchd_wrapper.sh contains some opts and stuff.
The org.apache.tomcat.plist was copied to /Library/LaunchDaemons.
The tomcat shell script was copied to ~/bin.  It is used to start
and stop the tomcat service using the launch_wrapper.sh and plist.
I found a nice article on maintainable shell scripts and created a 
~/bin/utilities.sh with a couple of examples and refered to it from
~/bin/tryme.sh.  It asks a question and takes action.
BTW, the launchd_wrapper.sh refers to ~/.bashrc just in case.

---20140128 12:02:40
Installed mosh on xanadu, barsoom, and woo-laptop.  It works fine
between woo-laptop and barsoom.  Doesn't work with xanadu.
mosh is a faster and more reliable ssh apparently.

Fixed the view portion of FreeMindArchiver, I believe.
Adjusted the menuNotifier to handle some things better.
Began to create the MergePanel so that we can alter
the set of new, edited, and deleted lists that get committed.

---20140130 10:24:59
changed interactive_timeout, wait_timeout, and max_connections 
on barsoom mysql by:
starting mysql from command line, then
set global max_connections = 500;
set global interactive_timeout = 600;
set gloval wait_timeout = 600;
command from woo-laptop is mysql --host barsoom -u woo -p ( enter passwd)

---20140130 10:27:42
created mysql_status in ~/bin.  Takes one or two arguments
run as mysql_status proc stat for instance.  Enter db pw of random1
May create some aliases which run this with different standard arguments

---20140131 12:18:32
Fixed email on Mantis to use the jwooten37830@gmail.com.  Tested.

---20140201 14:23:34
Downloaded BlockHosts-2.7.0.  It is supposed to scan log files
periodically and block breakin attempts after a few times.
Need to figure out how to get to work on Mac and then install on barsoom.
Installed /etc/blockhosts.cfg with minimal info and
/etc/hosts.allow and ran sudo blockhosts.py and it didn't complain.

---20140201 14:50:29
Apparently the logs are in /private/var/log/system.log
and can be looked at with syslog -C 
 tail -n 50 ( maybe in Geektool )
Add an egrep -e 'sshd
ftpd
afp
vnc' etc.  to look for violations?

---20140201 15:10:35
This apparently works as a geek script to watch for breakin attempts
syslog 
 tail -n50 
 egrep  -E "ftp
ssh"  looking for ftp or ssh.

---20140202 11:14:18
Updated mm_prod database, dropped PreOp and reloaded from
map Chris sent me in docs/maps.  Set databaseVersion to 1_27a

Robert found bug in release where copied node from one map was not
correct in pasted map.  The childMap attribute was not getting set.
Corrected that, reduced printouts, removed some updateMenus.
Created new version V_1_27b by merging it into HEAD.  Released to Chris.
Working in V_1_27b now.

---20140203 12:42:36
Decided to let the mysql handle the number of connections.  I have edited
my.cnf in /etc to set maximum to 500 and timeouts to 10 minutes.
TODO-still could reduce amount of printout.  (look at connections then )

Using:
echo "Barsoom Hackers?" ; ssh barsoom syslog 
 tail -n10 
 egrep  -E "ftp
ssh"; echo "\nsystem.log";  ssh barsoom grep "POSSIBLE" /private/var/log/system.log 
 cut -d " " -f 8 
 sort 
 uniq -c
to look at number of messages in syslog that are POSSIBLE BREAK-IN attempts

Created rsync_doc.sh to copy freemind docs to barsoom website.
Run after creating new pdfs for freemind.

---20140206 18:33:55
Got revert mostly working.  It marks all unapproved in latest to approved,
then copies original nodes below.  They should be in their original state.
But, it appears that the approval process by itself is not preserving
earlier states, #502.  We should copy the edited node before marking it approved!
Fixed history graph so that it now shows reverts in red, offset correctly.
Also fixed so that state between graph and tabs is correct.
Now getting a review changes after being in branch produces a commit
to the branch!  #504.
Also, getting notice after creating a branch and checking its review changes
that the panel says it is not the latest, # 503.

Worked a bit with ~/Development/Forth/fiji.1.2_beta
I created a shell script in ~/bin named fiji which launches
the fiji "forth-like" interpreter.
First cd to ~/Development/Forth/fiji.1.2_beta/com/SoftWoehr/FiJi/examples/fiji/io.
then start fiji > fiji
type cat.fiji load
Then filename cat will list out the contents of the file.
../util/dir.fiji load will load the dir utility
and ../util dir will list the contents of the util directory
../awt/hellowin.fiji load loads an awt window example
follow directions.

Just for fun, I downloaded the scripts for running a bourne shell
web server pages.  I moved in.httpd.sh and shspc.sh into /usr/local/bin
and made them executable.  I also moved the inetd script into ~/bin as http
for now.  To make it run, apparently I need to move http into the /etc/xinet.d ( or equivalent )
and then send HUP signal to xinetd.  Then a page like:
<html>
   <body>
      <h1><$ echo "Hello, world!" $></h1>
   </body>
</html>
Will produce a web page.  Any borne shell commands can go between
the <$ and $> While <title><` $JAVA_HOME `></title>
would cause the variable $JAVA_HOME to be evaluated and appear as
the title.
The tag <^ ... ^> means to include other stuff where the ... is.
So <^ more.shit ^> would be replaced by evaluating the server page
more.shit.
shspc.sh converts .shit files into .sh scripts.  They are served by
in.httpd.sh which is the web server.

---20140213 10:13:33

Time Capsule, Time Machine.  Learned that if you press Option Key and
click on the Time Machine icon at the top of the screen, that you can
browse other time machines you have things on.  Also, that if you are
alternating between backup devices as I do on LaCie and Time Machine-1
that what you can access from the Time Machine "star wars" view is the
latest device you backed up to.  The others show, but can't be used for
recovery.  To access them, disconnect the one you don't want to use, then
do another backup to the one you want.  Then open time machine and you'll
be able to recover from those dates.  I now have access back to Sept
2013 on my Time Machine-1!

Added queue_manager to bin.  Start it with queue_manager &
It runs in background every 5 seconds.  To put jobs into the queue
create a script that is bash compatable in a file, say test.job
Then do: create_job
It will ask for email address and name of file.
Then do submit test.job.  It will get submitted to the queue.  You
will be notified when the job starts and completes.
waiting tells what is in the queue.  stop_queue stops the queue.
so:
create_job, submit, queue_manager, and waiting are part of the ability
to submit batch jobs and run them one after another.
Does it need logging?  Be sure jobs send their output somewhere.

---20140417 18:17:18
Can now create a test.job file, then do create_job
and tell it to submit.  it will send a notification to
the requested email addr if you say so.  It uses the information

sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_password if you change things.
Then be sure /etc/postfix/main.cf has smtp_sasl_auth_enable=yes, etc.
Then either sudo postfix start or sudo postfix reload.
Then date

Downloaded and installed pip a package manager for phython.
used ~/bin/install_pip.py, a self installer using sudo.
The did pip search "pygmentize" to locate name
then did pip install tw.pygmentize using sudo again.
Then pygmentize utilities.sh worked, so turned it back on
in .bashrc for less using lessfilter.sh in ~/bin

Started doing an ant build script to run tests.  Learned a lot,
but couldn't get it to work right.  Abandoned. Did copy
junit-4.8.2.jar to the antlib home and renamed it junit.jar
then put that in classpath in build.xml and it worked.
Started building a CompareFiles.java that will split the appended
AllTests.txt into two arrayLists and then compare them after filtering
and detect changes.  Currently working on writing the filter.

The kepler eclipse preferences settings for the workspace are located at:
workspaces/archiver/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings
in prefs extension files.  For instance, org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs 
contains the names of the xml formatter and cleanup files along with
the settings for all of the cleanup options, etc.

model getting compiled and running, but says arrays exceed memory.
The value being printed out as needed is WAY too big. Look at ptr calculation.
Installed gfortran in /usr/local/gfortran/bin/gfortran
Then created link to it as ln -s /usr/bin/gfortran /usr/local/gfortran/bin/gfortran


---20140429 10:42:40
Downloaded wget and installed it on barsoom into /usr/local/bin.
Checked that it was installed.
Then on barsoom, did cvs co CVSROOT into ~woo.
Then added a directory under CVSROOT called scripts
and put postCommitTriggerBuild.sh there and chmoded to a+x.
Then added a line to CVSROOT/loginfo, viz.
archiver /Users/woo/cvsrep/CVSROOT/scripts/postCommitTriggerBuild.sh.
did cvs add scripts, cvs add scripts/postcommitTriggerBuild.sh
then cd CVSROOT, and cvs commit to commit all of this.
Set Jenkins to only update if triggered and tested.  No trigger!
Then committed a broken file and hand started the build.  No error!
DONE:  More work on Jenkins

---20140429 11:11:15
Although jenkins is only accepting anonymous and not my ssh key,
it still is doing an update from cvs, but not compiling the code.
I guess I have to add that as a post checkout action in jenkins
and have it run an Ant script to compile.  After this works, it
can checkout archiverTest and then compile and run the tests.

---20140429 11:15:53
Made a change in Base, then committed.  Did not auto trigger, BUT
I then ran jenkins build -c archiver and it produced a build.

---20140429 14:43:40
Downloaded wget into ~/tmp by:
cd ~/tmp
curl -O http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.13.4.tar.gz
Then:

cd wget-1.13.4
./configure --with-ssl=openssl
make
sudo make install
test with:
wget --help
The code is installed into /usr/local/bin.
Then cleanup with:
cd .. && rm -rf wget*
All done!

---20140429 15:12:27
Copied ecj*.jar from tomcat lib to ANT_HOME/lib.  Still didn't solve
problem of missing class when trying to run ant build from eclipse.

---20140430 08:37:42
The build.xml file in archiver/archiver works from the command line.
ant clean, then ant build-project creates the runnable files.
ant Archiver then runs FreemindArchiver successfully.
It probably needs lib checked out and possibly something Eclipse,
but it's close.  I think I can fix it so that lib and archiver are there
and then build-project to see if all compiles.
Create another like this for archvierTests and we should be able
to run the tests after a commit also.

---20140430 22:45:05
Got ant script to work on barsoom.  It now checks out ( updates ) from
archiver, then runs the ant script to compile.  If errors, it sends me 
email.  Will now add new target to script to check out archiverTest,
compile it, then run the tests.  Installed ant from download site.

---20140501 08:30:41
Got archiverTests to be checked out and compiled and got a .freemind/properties
into place for it.  Now, it seems to need a X11-Display to be set
to run headless.  Possible download and install Xvnc plugin.
Might try runnnin without turning on headless.

---20140505 14:36:49
Created new_workspace.sh that should create a new workspace and
copy over the setting from an old one.  See about altering this so
that it allows Robert and I to copy our settings between each other also.

---20140512 14:48:14
Downloaded html5 zip file for evaluation.  It's in Downloads.

~/Development/GeneticAlgorithms has good code for PlotXY, Histogram,
FrameConstraint, layout, etc.  Also good notes about threading, notification,
and running applet as application.

---20140520 10:33:04
Updated TestPlans.tex and ran scripts to create tabular test plans
and then create test plan then rsync to move to server.  Had to split
the table of actions into two tables.  Need to find out how to get rid
of the two side feature.

---20140520 11:20:34
Check on sc_demo again.  Had to change to woo/random1 for several
places as I had changed the root password, etc. on the database.
It now shows queue entries and can sort of work.  Needs a lot of
review.  Need to be able to delete entries that aren't good.

---20140520 13:56:39
Used OmniGraffle to create an abbreviated sequence diagram for
Franklin Planner.  Is in Documents/Discussions.

---20140521 18:18:53
Added an InspectEventHandler to sc_demo.  It currently just
returns an error message.  It uses the homeAdmin.js that replaces
the home.js in the queueAdmin.jsp.  When you click on a task entry
it should cause the queue entry to be brought up for inspection.
Choices then should be to delete, delete job?, change status to
active, requeue to another, look at history?, also need to be sure
we get all that are active, or waiting.

---20140522 14:14:46
Did an initial creation of iPhone Planning look and feel.  It
shows Daily Tasks, Schedule and Notes.  Still need to add
Daily Tracker and try to position at bottom.  Then add sections
for Master Tasks, and Monthly Calendar.  Look up how to get
Calendar entries to put into Schedule.

---20140528 16:31:34
Received VA access and put into Evernote.  Need to test.
Also, reworked the handling in View of the transfer node checking
to make sure we aren't pasting an ancestor to a descencent which
would cause a loop.

---20140529 12:26:47
Installed latest TomEE-plus in /usr/local and shortcut in /Library/TomEE-Plus
It appears it is a full stack.  If I can create war files for sc_demo
and the services, they MIGHT run in this stack.  I can then install it
on barsoom, and perhaps use it from Eclipse.

---20140529 16:06:10
Got Netbeans working again.  Problem seemed to be the Exceptions.
I explicitely referenced ClassNotFoundException, SQLException, ParseException
and created a TransactionFailedException.  I also had to recover
Scope.java from an older version.  The TimeCapsule is not working right.
I have only one days backups.  I can find the files on the drives, but they 
show as not there in the TimeCapsule history.

---20140529 16:08:11
I created a ~/Archives/sc_demo_201400529 directory with all source
and libraries zipped up.

---20140530 07:48:29
Enter sudo tmutil disablelocal to disable local backups. But, these
are only done if not connected to external Time Machine and will be
deleted if disk space goes above 80%.

---20140611 09:36:47
Corrected bug in Archiver where a failure to obtain a lock on the log
file caused an exception which then prevented the settings of the 
database url, userid, password, and documentation url.
Now, Version 1_29c uses the -D paramenters if there, but overwrites
them with anything found in the user preferences under .freemind.
Uploaded to VA 10.70.255.115 by emailing from laptop to jwooten37830@gmail.com
then logging into it as administrator/PICIS1231! ( or !1 ), opening
Internet Explorer and downloading the jarfile from there to C:
Edited archiver.bat so that it uses 1_29c and specifies documentation url as
http://localhost/freemind/index.html

---20140611 10:26:18
uploaded current documentation for Archiver using gmail and installed
on Program Files/aamps/www/freemind and updated index.html to use
correct name for Installation Manual.  Saved old copies to backups
in same directory.  Need to update documents so that they refer to
V_1_29c.

  DESCRIPTION
  Calculates the age in years

  The calcage package can calculate the age of someone or something in years.
  Internally it uses the datenumber package to calculate the age in days. The
  conversion from days to years is implemented by this package. It is also taken
  care about leap years and such odd things.

Created a web service for motd by creating a dynamic web project
then a class called MotdMonitor in a package.
I then added a method status() which returned hello world.
Added an @WebService annotation to the class and clicked on
generate web service in eclipse.  Selected also to create the web client and test it.
It generated everything and brought up a web page to click "Invoke"
It worked!
Then slowly changed the status method to get the /etc/motd and check
for the connection to mysql.  If ALERT: stuff :ALERT or the mysql
connection is down, then it returns that fact in the xml string
Used the Result.jsp page to figure out what the code was for
getting the service and invoking the status() method.
Created a jsp that did that directly called SampleGetStatus.jsp
It can be run from localhost:8080/motd/Client/sampleMotdMonitorProxy/SampleGetStatus.jsp
Then created a java class in the clent project called TestServiceInvocation
which gets the xml, uses a DOM parser to get the alert message
and prints it out.
I had to add the mysql connection jar to the /lib directory in Tomcat8
in order for the connector to work.
Now I need to create a timer that invokes the service every few minutes
and IF there is an ALERT or MYSQL, it brings up a JOptionPane to inform
the user.  Otherwise it leaves a pulsing green light in the lower right
corner meaning the mysql connection is still alive.
If it goes down, then tell the user to save their file locally and
set hasDatabase to false;

---20141110 17:07:10
Added crack to bin/alias.  Typing crack takes you to the cracking
directory.  there john --show passwd will give list

---20141111 12:16:52
Created BlinkingStatusDemo to blink an icon every second.
Extend and use to display a blinking green filled circle while
connection status is okay. Check status using MotdService every
10 seconds or so.  If ALERT or MYSQL, then display JOptionPane and
change connection status, etc.

---20141112 10:04:39
Created shell script ~/bin/pre_clone.sh which does a mysqldump
of my important databases to /etc/recover.  The script has
a commented out prescription on how to recover the databases
if they don't start automatically when the clone is restored.
I add the script to CCC to create the dumps before cloning
to cloned disk. I need to get a 4 TByte thunderbold drive
and clone barsoom, iTunes, then my mac-book, then Diannes desktop.
It will then go into the safe.  I'll try to do this every week.

---20141114 16:53:43
Installed a ssh guard by: sudo port install sshguard
It looks at the syslog and if it finds failed ssh authentication errors
it then blocks the responsible ip address for awhile.  If the attempt
continues, then it makes the block longer.  It tries to fix
breakin attempts.                                          

---20141125 15:54:48
Have created a new sc_demo but not checked it in.  It uses a web service
called com.shoulderscorp.services.TaskListWSProxy.  It currently
works with getTaskListForUser.  Need to move more jsps, etc.
Start with Navigation and getting the set of applications
and processes, so probably a new service.

Managed to restore sc_demo to running in Tomcat8 barely.
It shows Applications and TaskList.  Nothing else yet.
It is archived on desktop as sc_demo_141129.zip.
For some reason, TimeMachine won't go back more than a day or so.

---20141201 15:53:31
Got base of sc_demo working in Tomcat8!  Problem was Dependencies in IDE. Under properties.
Next thing to do is add webservice references from StateMachineWSClient.

To restore a database first cd to /var/backup/db/daily/mm_prod ( for instance)
Then, gunzip < daily_mm_prod_2014-12-05_15h04m_Friday.sql.gz 
 mysql -u root -p  -D mm_prod
If you are trying to get the Friday ... backup into mm_prod.
database backups are in /var/backup/db by daily weekly monthly, etc.

Added EasySIMBL to Utilities.  Ability to drop plugins into it
that modify other applications or OS itself.

---20141219 14:18:09
At 2:18 did Time Machine backup.  sc_demo working
NetBeans version worked fine.  sc_authenticate, sc_base,sc_demo, sc_utilities
sc_notifyingStateMachine, TaskListService, StateMachineService.
sc_authenticate in workspaces/sc_statemachine
sc_base in workspaces/sc_statemachine
sc_demo in NetBeansProjects/sc_demo
sc_notifyingStateMachine in workspaces/sc_statemachine
sc_utilities in workspaces/sc_statemachine
StateMachineService in NetBeansProjects
TaskListService in NetBeansProjects
Verified that TaskListService as modified is correct at 2:18

---20141219 14:40:47
Renamed Documents/workspace to workspace_bak. Only use
NetBeans version from now on.  Delete this workspace_bak
when sure that all else is okay.
