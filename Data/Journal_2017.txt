Set up Fidelity and Metlife to do monthly withdrawals of $1100.00 less 10% Federal taxes starting Feb 1, 2017.

Copied BU_011217 to Downloads.  Contains a lot of stuff from 2001.

Installed node.js and npm via below, then installed sails and created newProject
  brew install node
  node -v
  npm -v
  npm install -g sails
  cd Development/
  mkdir Sails
  cd Sails
  l
  sails new newProject
  cd newProject
  npm install
  sails lift
  The above causes the sails application to be started and found at "http://localhost:1337"

To allow install from anywhere run: sudo spctl --master-disable and reopen System Preferences

Exported Evernote notes to Notes as Notebook_title.

Had to install homebrew on barsoom as it and cvs were lost
during a recent update to OS X Sierra, possibly 10.12.
Then installed cvs using brew so that cvs would work from laptop.
Separately found that ant no longer worked on laptop and installed it
using brew.  Now running ant run in btree fails for bad character
for conversion to UTF8 in KWIC.java, about line 149.
Eclipse will not show the btree project for some reason.  Works for
sc_workspace, however.  Also in btree, no ability to see cvs repository.

---20170410 12:07:44
Need to reviw work in sc_workspace, btree, chatbot, etc.  as not sure
of where I am on these projects.  Look at mantis for some hints.
Also, add more status notes to projects.

Took Enbrel shot.

To allow download and install from anywhere do: sudo spctl --master-disable, then relaunch System Preferences

Got nextdb_new to compile and link.  Can't decipher commands now.
Only have tried in XCode.  Can try using debugger there.

---20170803 11:24:00
The version of nextdb in cvs works fine except a few commands aren't
implemented.  It appears that if I compile it now with no changes, it 
gets a segmentation error.  Compiler interpreting things differently?

---20170803 12:13:26
Try copying driver.c to new file nextdb.c.  Then compile it and run against
already compiled obj codes.

---20170803 12:15:06
The cvs version has no obj/*.o files!  Can't proceed.

---20170803 12:19:43
Going to drop work on nextdb for now as checked in version works.
The problem appears to be changes in the compiler that don't allow
or interpret differently some of the 'sloppy' coding in nextdb.
Will go back to btree and perhaps ObjDB to see what happens.

---20170823 17:40:36
cd now works allowing fi lN = baggett after finished loading.  
BUT, if you do a close, then an open and do a ds,
it gets a segmentation fault.  
Might be not doing rewinds, but put them in and didn't fix it.  
Still a problem when saving the database.  
WHY are there two block '2' in the list of buffers?  
one has frozen = -1, others have 0.  
Is the first the associator?  
If so why would there be another block 2 that would overwrite it?
Does assoc block get written out last?  

---20170827 16:35:43
Created a dumpFile in C that dumps out blocks of a file in hex and ascii.
It assumes the BLOCKSIZE is BUFFSIZE in buffer.h, currently either 2048
or 4096.  This should be a 3rd argument.
Still having problems in that if I cd newdb databases/test/test,
a database is created and performs reasonably well.  However,
cl ( close ) and the op ( open ) it fails doing a ds ( display status )
in that it cannot find the information on file ussage, etc.  Need to 
try to be sure that after doing the cd, I do a flush some way, perhaps CO for
commit, then dumpFile on assoc and data, then compare to what was in the buffers
when I did the db ( debug ) and turned trace on and did buffer asc 2, etc.

Tested that moving diary into bin works from remote directory.

Fixed problem with positioning for reading isn block.  Now, the RP for
read physical is the one that fails.  Need to add a '*' as a synonym for all.
Then fi LN = * should give all records with a last name.
Committed all changes to cvs.

---20170830 20:49:42
When doing the fi LN = baggett against test created by testRWdata,
although there are 2 baggetts, it only finds the first one.

---20170903 12:47:21
I got the dl working down to where the al_isnput is run.  It gets
a segmentation fault there.  Addresses etc. seem okay.  Need to write
a test just of doing an avl_isnput into a location in a buffer.

---20170905 15:49:54
Having to recover.  Somehow lost progress on the positioning of isn block
etc.  BE MORE CAREFUL.  Will switch to new branch to fix after I 
get this checked in and onto va-air.

---20170906 12:54:20
Look at testsuite.c, addrec.c, add_avl.c in previous saves to see the changes
I made.  Somehow the source isn't getting passed in?

---20170911 13:41:34
Did cvs co of nextdb to ~/Development/workspaces so that I have the
latest on both cvs and on woo-laptop, and am working on woo-va-air.
The version checked out on woo-laptop is the saved version.  The one on
woo-va-air is the development version.  I am going to merge the
development version back into the HOME stream.

---20170913 11:58:30
Cleaned up a new Makefile that does most of what I want, but doesn't use
the original NeXT Makefile as I'd like.  Probably need to reorganize my
files into the structure NeXT expected then it might work.
Outstanding problems with nextdb are: testRWdata fails on Read Physical
and when editing the last name and state of a record, it changes the phone
number.

---20170915 12:15:00
Created a cvs repository project with the name of lib_woo, which
contains the ~woo/lib directory contents.  If it is needed on another machine
then in ~woo, do cvs co lib_woo.  Then compare ~/lib with ~/lib_woo.
Copy any files that are different from lib_woo to lib.  Then delete
lib_woo.  Similarly temporarily rename lib to lib_woo and cd into lib_woo.
Then cvs commit any local changes, then cd .., then rename back to lib.
I believe there is a way to rename as checking out, etc., but this works.

---20170923 13:06:32
Screwed up on the branch when I made a version in the branch.  Don't do that!
Had to create a branch_170917.tar from tar -cf branch_170917.tar *.[ch],
then saved it .., then cd .., rm -rf nextdb, then back into Eclipse, delete
nextdb project, then use CVS repository explorer to check out HEAD,
then cd nextdb, rm -f *.[ch], then cp branch...tar into nextdb, then
tar -xvf branch_170917.tar to get source files back.  Then had to recover
Makefiles from time machine as they were not checked in!  Finally got
nextdb working and updated HEAD.  Made a tarfile DATE=170923 for safety.

---20170923 14:02:15
Had to add $(HEADERS) to ~/lib/Makefile.common for TARFILES.  It wasn't 
including them in the tar it created!

---20170927 13:46:07
Seem to be getting MOST of fi command working, BUT in a list of fi LN = barry
one isn = 11 shows up that should not be in the list.  It does not appear
to be an off by one error.  It's just wrong.  The entire storing of the
avl isns and retrieval suffer from this mysterious adding and subtracting one.
This really needs cleaning up.  Where does this extra value in FI show up?
ALSO, run testFind and see this list of 44 isns.  The database is closed.  When
it is opened by driver, we see the lastisn = 7.  WTF?  A dump of the assoc
block seems to show that 55 is the lastisn.  Where does this 7 come from? AND,
a logical dump of the database using db logical only shows 3 records! WTF?

---20170927 14:22:29
Have registerrd the lldb program used for debugging like gdb but does
c, c++, Objective-C, and Swift.  Whoopee!

---20171004 13:50:08
Clean up knownhosts on woo-laptop.  It appears to have WAY too many. Can't
ssh from woo-va-air.

---20171004 21:03:44
I have done an ssh-keygen without a passphrase on woo-va-air.  On each machine
I connect to, I should do a ssh-copy-id remote-server.  Then test with
ssh remote-server.  I guess I repeat in each direction.

---20171207 11:32:53
Installed FileZilla on barsoom to try to get WordPress to allow installation
using sftp.  sftp already works, so I don't understand.  Does it use
a different port like 2222 instead of 22?  For now, I just deactivated
the reCaptcha plugin as I could not get it to install.

---20171219 16:59:57
Found that mysql is failing on woo-va-air because of a corrupted database.  I 
think I will compress the data dump from woo-laptop, move it to va-air, then
uncompress and install it.

---20171221 14:34:49
Created a Memo_Template.tex and placed it in ~/Library/TeXShop/Stationery
along with a brief Memo_Template.comment file ( prepared in TeXShop as
a simple text file).  I added the \age function and it allows figures
as a part of it.

---20171222 14:04:04
Problems with sc_demo.  Remember that it runs under netbeans.  There
is a disagreement about COMMENT column, possibly was MSG?  Straighten
this up.

---20171225 12:08:50
Verified that rails and sails both are installed and working.  Can run
rails by rails server  and sails by sails lift select 3 or drop in development
