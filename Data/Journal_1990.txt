Returned call to Mr. Richardson, representing IG's office (4-1933)
He reviewed purpose of his questions re: 941 with Mantech. He suggested
that an Invoice # 13 existed for a credit of 85K.  He also said the
unpaid balance we had was 55K.  With the 85K credit, then the 131K
outstanding overrun could be paid.  I have no such invoice, nor has
Debra seen one.  He will call Bridges and get back to me.  I explained
that I was the replacement Project Manager and held up several invoices
until I could verify funding existed, work done, etc.
