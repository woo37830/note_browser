He reviewed purpose of his questions re: 941 with Mantech. He suggested
that an Invoice # 13 existed for a credit of 85K.  He also said the
unpaid balance we had was 55K.  With the 85K credit, then the 131K
outstanding overrun could be paid.  I have no such invoice, nor has
Debra seen one.  He will call Bridges and get back to me.  I explained

Gave demo to Col xxx of AIA this morning.  He appeared interested.  Said he
would provide some money to support "me" in some data fusion work.  Wasn't too
concerned about $1 million tag on Thinking machine for prototype, but
perked up when I mentioned work on $5K version (He wants lots in the field).

smalltalk, scheme, Xlisp, etc. there also.  Will have to explore that

Also started having problems with NeXT version of WWW.  Unix version
doesn't access WAIS correctly, could be problem with telnet again? NeXT
version just dies!

correctly.  Installed man pages in local/man.  May have deleted cat1?
Moved cut* and paste* to ~/bin.  Moved getopt.c to ~/src. Have to think about
snobol4 some more.  Starchar seems to work but needs 4 arguments.  Run
planet - to generate planet.star, then starpost -RA -DC -VW "title" > test.ps

Demo went well and program worked flawlessly.
Need to think about sub-maps that are "groupings" of nodes that are tagged 
and can be reused elsewhere by name when inserting a new node OR group of nodes.
Next big item is importing maps with VA ids and doing a generate of
ids and changes for vendors.  ***DONE***

Created automysqlbackup to do automatic backups on mysql databases.
It currently does mm_test, blog_db, and bugtracker every day and rotates
weekly etc.  It does a full backup of the entire database monthly.
the backups are done to /var/backup/db.  To see them right now,
do su/Fester. I changed the access to 755.  Check this.

----Tue Nov 22 18:23:59 EST 2011---
Added a /etc/daily.local with the line to /User/woo/bin/daily_tasks.sh

Cache.plist in it.  Move it to LaunchDaemons/backup.
Found that .rlogin.rc has some good things in it about calendar which appears

Run ant run to build jar file, then java -cp btree.... com.shoulderscorp.btree.KWICmain with DragDrop.txt in same dir.
Note that need to get rid of leading and trailing quites, etc. and also
group items using TreeMap so they come out sorted.
----Thu Dec 15 10:19:04 EST 2011---
Downloaded and did build of lucene.  It provides stemming, and other text handling featrues that coulc be useful in redaction or in KWIC.  I placed it in Development/workspaces and intend for it to be an eclipse project.
One thing to look at in the current KWIC (and in the Test HTML highlighter is to be sure that I'm reading the data in like I do in StyledText.  This may be why the funny characters are in the text.

BUT, it was also necessary to remove non-printable characters using
the pattern I blogged today.

Downloaded and installed JDepend plugin for Eclipse.  Important to click on the src folders, not the projects.
Also downloaded and installed the JDepend zip file and installed it into
~woo/lib and added the CLASSPATH and JDEPEND_HOME as stated in the
web page under ~/Documents/Reference/JDepend.html.  Tested and got it to work.
cd to Development/workspaces/btree/target and did
java jdepend.swingui.JDepend classes to see ui.
java jdepend.textui.JDepend -file report.txt classes to see text ui.
Also possible to get xml using xmlui.
There is an interesting FitNesse that gives a graph.  I'll have to try that.
----Wed Dec 21 13:50:17 EST 2011---
Downloaded statcvs.jar and placed it into ~/lib/jars along with html page.
The command java -jar ~/lib/jars/statcvs.jar logfile.log ../sc_workspace
creates a massive number of html files in the directory sc_workspace with
stats about cvs activity, etc.  It must be preceded by a cvs log > logfile.log
command.  Looks good for monitoring cvs usage and watching for problems in
combination with JDepend above.
----Wed Dec 21 14:45:47 EST 2011---
Created two bash scripts to run svnstat and cvsstat each with the name
of the project to be analyzed.  They check out the code into ~/tmp and either
redaction for svn or cvsstat for cvs.  They do the analysis and then
attempt to start firefox on the index page.  They won't work if firefox is running yet.

map_terms.pl creates an xml file of the nodes to do a commit.
Create file, open it, do checkin.  cardio.mm is a short test.
Updated freemap so that it saved the additional columns. ( need to update sql and documentation )
Updated so that it could checkout and display all attributes ( fixed the dependency on 4 attributes at least in the checkout.  Check other places )
Need to add a way to create the genericIds when they are not there.  Possibly a separate menu item?  
Need to insert a table generic ID, verdor name, vendor display.  Have them filled in ( perhaps separately from generic load ).
Write a report to display the genericId, concatenated text, vendor stuff?
----Wed Dec 28 11:59:13 EST 2011---
Added vendorDisplay where genericId is mapped via vendorId to the vendor specific display.  vendor 0 means the alternate display.
Added the change_requests table with change requests.  Not clear how to use.
Will add a right click on node to show vendor display for that node (and revision history?)
Will add menu item to create generic ids if null?
Bring up list of CRs avail when ready to commit? via mag glass icon?

----Wed Dec 28 17:09:21 EST 2011---
Got reading of icon and color and cloud right.  Storing is still off
as it's storing java.awt.Color... and images/icons/idea.png... instead
of a #3Cffff and "idea".  Also is updating every node because compare is wrong because of above.
----Thu Dec 29 18:42:38 EST 2011---

Tried to install a file-uploader but no joy yet.
----Wed Jan  4 13:48:33 EST 2012---
Got the http://localhost/~woo/upload/index.php uploader to work.  It was
the file permission on the upload folder under Sites needed to be a+w.
Fixing the permissions on valums or fileUploader did not help those however.
The simplest however is just ~woo/upload_file.html which uses upload_file.php
----Wed Jan  4 15:27:34 EST 2012---
Fixed the timelogger so that it does 201201 instead of 20121
Found that to put html into word press had to surround by <pre><code> </code></pre> AND replace < by &lt; and > by &gt;  (create macro?)
----Wed Jan  4 15:52:53 EST 2012---
Got the image in upper left of index.html to stay fixed and not scroll by
using fixed.  Can't see how to move it anywhere else yet, however.
----Thu Jan  5 12:40:06 EST 2012---
Left nodes are being added and persisted.  Links to other maps or to other nodes within a map are working and being persisted.  Colors are persisted. Diff shows the removed properly (with orientation correct) and new and edited colors temporarily.

----Thu Jan 19 17:03:44 EST 2012---
Fixed some unnecessary work being done when scanning and moved
the presentation of the results into the finally block so always there.
Added a LoginHook and LogoutHook through defaults write, but LoginHook, which
brings up the PromptForClient screen fails with an exit code of 2.
Found ScreenSaver 3 which will run applescript on screensave, etc. but

Installed HomeBrew then did brew install play to install Play framework
Seems to be much like the ruby on rails in that it creates a framework for applications.
Seems to have build in hibernate and easy connection to mysql database for persistence
new installs seem to go to /user/local/Cellar and then are linked to proper places.

I cd'd to NetbeansProjects and then did a play new yabe
which created a yabe directory.  cd'd into yabe and typed play run
which allowed me to go to browser at http://localhost:9000/ and see the default
I then experimented with changing Application.java removing the trailing ;
and refreshed to see the error message.  Changed it back.
Then edited the conf/application.conf and turned on the memory db for testing
now see the Connected to jdbc:h2:mem:play;MODE=MYSQL
then edited the views/Application/index.html removing the #{welcome} and
replacing it with <h1>A blog goes here</h1>.  Refresh and see that instead
of default.
Then cd'd to ~/NetbeansProjects/yabe directory
Then created file .cvsignore with lines tmp, modules, lib, test-result, and logs
Then did cvs import yabe INITIAL start
and got a screen to fill in the initial information about the project
followed by cvs importing the code.  checked on xanadu and found that
yabe had been created correctly without the extra files to ignore!
----Mon Jan 23 16:51:47 EST 2012---
Continued and created first blog screen, saved to cvs.
Remember to do cvs -n update to see what files to add after cd'ing to project

Did some refactoring in the ARK project to put actions in freemind.database.action and the panels that have been
refactored into freemind.database.action.panel.  Also added a new Maint menu item with a dummy MaintAction and a MaintPanel for now.  They will handle actions like delete a map, roll back to a date, add a user, etc.

Added a check for ~/tmp/.pfc file in beginning of PromptForClient.  If there, exit.  Else, create that file with the

Removed all &, commas, and 's, from xsft file, saved as csv.
Used map_terms.pl to load into database.
Then cleared the vendorDisplay table as the etl_display.pl does not skip over existing entries yet.  Got it to load the vendor display table.
Did backup on xanadu called 120220_1720.sql of all tables.

Then be able to display map by CR # if not approved ( new column in links with approval date ).  Now show diff before CR # and with CR #.  Have new button "Approve/Dissapprove".  If Approve, then put approval date on diff rows and commit.  If Dissapprove, then commit, but don't put approval time.  now for a release show the map with approved changes (diff between previous version), or unapproved( diff between previous version(release) ).  Then create release with only approved links.

Had thought to create services ( probably using NetBeans )
    1)  getUsersApplicationsAndProcesses
        returns xml with applications and processes user can initiate
    2)  getUsersTasks
        returns xml with tasks user can service
    3)  startProcess
        initiates a process given user token, application, process, organization
    4)  deQueueProcess
        dequques a process from the tasks and present screen
    5)  advanceProcess
        takes process id, usertoken, xml of data from form
        and event name and advanes the process.
    6)  authenticate
        takes user token and determines if it is still valid.  
        If not, asks for reauthentication.  Updates token after
        checking if user is still a valid user.

    Now, web pages are mostly jsp, presenting xml, calling services.
        All statemachine activity is handled in the service calls.
    Data becomes xml which is persisted, etc.

    different look and feels and allow a question, returning the answer.
    At this time the kb isn't any good.  So the answer is no answer.

Created a copy of FreeMindArchiver in Jet using VMFusionWare Windooze
    It ran fine on my VMs, but the packaged version wouldn't start
    and the executable, which ran fine, did not run at VISN8 since
    it did not have the Jet installer.  Have to package for it to run.
    Will have to redo and find out why the installer version won't run.
    It says it cannot do FreeMindMain Mode.
    Perhaps create a different start point?  One that doesn't do the

Created NetBeans projects for StateMachineWS, StateMachineWSJSPClient,
    TaskListWS, TaskListWSClient.
    These were deployed and return xml ( in a SOAP envelope? )
    to a jsp index.jsp.  The xml is correct and I created a
    set of testHTML.xml for the xml returned so that I could put
    the proper xsl at the top with <head> etc.  It then 
    displays the xml as a table as I want.

    However, when I try to take the data and transform it in the jsp
    it gives me the values in result, but no formatting?  Also, a problem
    on getting the "output" which is a var into the html pieces.

----Fri Feb  8 22:09:41 EST 2013---
TaskListWSClient demonstrates using two web services to create
    the home page ( home.jsp ), using two xsl sheets, one to style
    the tasklist (tasklist.xsl), and the other to layout the nav

    home.css positions the elements.

----Wed Feb 20 12:36:14 EST 2013---
To determine the number of samples for a C% confidence level and
    a E% max error rate, S = log(1-C)/log(1-E).  IF no errors found
    in the S samples, then the error rate is less than E% to a C%
    confidence level.  So, 1000 items, no more than 20 errors at
    95% confidence gives S = log(1-.95)/log(1-.02) = 148 ( roughly )

If you know the number of sample being taken, then
    the maximum number of errors in the population is
    E = 1-(1-C)^(1/S).  So, for C = .95, and S = 148,
    then E = 1 - .05^(1/148) = .02 => .02*1000 = 20, QEF
    That means that if you found no errors in the 148 samples
    then there are less than 20 errors in the 1000 population to the
    95% confidence level.

    BUT, notifier isn't in the environment sometimes.
    May have fixed it, but now I'm getting no server logging,
    and only part of the dispatcher log.  I don't see the notification
    messages, which I think means that the notifier isn't being
    found in the environment!  Do some testing on it.  Does
    it dump its guts correctly?  Am I getting things into env?

Apparently new employee fills in data, then oid changes before marking,

Got validation working with nice form labels ( in field ) for login.jsp
Backed up sc_demo to sc_demo_20130521.zip since things sometimes get
screwed up without warning.  Found nice article on validation
that using validator in the field so it might work well with xml
from the state model.  It has a standard validator in the header
for the activity.jsp, for instance.  Put it into Evernote with tag field

Added tablesorter javascript to ListCR.jsp and style sheets.
It now sorts and allows pagination, but some residual problems with
placement of the paginator when number of rows changes, and that
the 1 to 20 of 50 does not show at all.
Also, the sort arrows are too close to the text in the headers in small rows.
Maybe set their width?

Notes:
    Must currently have a <prerender> for each state!  fails if not.
    The use of "Quit" as an event name causes the item to be queued!
        Not sure if this is as it should be.  Perhaps handle it
        via the actionLibrary instead.  i.e. Quit just does exit or such
    It appears that substituting noop for abandonProcess causes an error

navigate down until you find the nextdb executable and copy it
to /usr/local/bin

Worked with Ken at HappyMac to fix problem of dmehelp.com not
redirecting to jwooten37830.com:8080.
He changed it so that in the file where the dmehelp.com files
are in the Server app, he put an index.html with
a piece of meta-data that redirects to http://dmehelp.com:8080
this fixed it.  Use for askjane and others!
Also, replaced the crontab @reboot with a set of files I tested on
my laptop and ftp'd into ~/ftp.  A launchd_wrapper.sh was then
copied to /Library/Tomcat/bin along with a do-nothing setenv.sh
The launchd_wrapper.sh contains some opts and stuff.
The org.apache.tomcat.plist was copied to /Library/LaunchDaemons.
The tomcat shell script was copied to ~/bin.  It is used to start
and stop the tomcat service using the launch_wrapper.sh and plist.
I found a nice article on maintainable shell scripts and created a 
~/bin/utilities.sh with a couple of examples and refered to it from
~/bin/tryme.sh.  It asks a question and takes action.
BTW, the launchd_wrapper.sh refers to ~/.bashrc just in case.

Got revert mostly working.  It marks all unapproved in latest to approved,
then copies original nodes below.  They should be in their original state.
But, it appears that the approval process by itself is not preserving
earlier states, #502.  We should copy the edited node before marking it approved!
Fixed history graph so that it now shows reverts in red, offset correctly.
Also fixed so that state between graph and tabs is correct.
Now getting a review changes after being in branch produces a commit
to the branch!  #504.
Also, getting notice after creating a branch and checking its review changes
that the panel says it is not the latest, # 503.

Just for fun, I downloaded the scripts for running a bourne shell
web server pages.  I moved in.httpd.sh and shspc.sh into /usr/local/bin
and made them executable.  I also moved the inetd script into ~/bin as http
for now.  To make it run, apparently I need to move http into the /etc/xinet.d ( or equivalent )
and then send HUP signal to xinetd.  Then a page like:
<html>
   <body>
      <h1><$ echo "Hello, world!" $></h1>
   </body>
</html>
Will produce a web page.  Any borne shell commands can go between
the <$ and $> While <title><` $JAVA_HOME `></title>
would cause the variable $JAVA_HOME to be evaluated and appear as
the title.
The tag <^ ... ^> means to include other stuff where the ... is.
So <^ more.shit ^> would be replaced by evaluating the server page
more.shit.
shspc.sh converts .shit files into .sh scripts.  They are served by
in.httpd.sh which is the web server.

Time Capsule, Time Machine.  Learned that if you press Option Key and
click on the Time Machine icon at the top of the screen, that you can
browse other time machines you have things on.  Also, that if you are
alternating between backup devices as I do on LaCie and Time Machine-1
that what you can access from the Time Machine "star wars" view is the
latest device you backed up to.  The others show, but can't be used for
recovery.  To access them, disconnect the one you don't want to use, then
do another backup to the one you want.  Then open time machine and you'll
be able to recover from those dates.  I now have access back to Sept
2013 on my Time Machine-1!

Added queue_manager to bin.  Start it with queue_manager &
It runs in background every 5 seconds.  To put jobs into the queue
create a script that is bash compatable in a file, say test.job
Then do: create_job
It will ask for email address and name of file.
Then do submit test.job.  It will get submitted to the queue.  You
will be notified when the job starts and completes.
waiting tells what is in the queue.  stop_queue stops the queue.
so:
create_job, submit, queue_manager, and waiting are part of the ability
to submit batch jobs and run them one after another.
Does it need logging?  Be sure jobs send their output somewhere.
----Thu Apr 17 18:17:18 EDT 2014---
Can now create a test.job file, then do create_job
and tell it to submit.  it will send a notification to
the requested email addr if you say so.  It uses the information
in /etc/postfix/sasl_password.  You have to 
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_password if you change things.
Then be sure /etc/postfix/main.cf has smtp_sasl_auth_enable=yes, etc.
Then either sudo postfix start or sudo postfix reload.
Then date | sendmail -s Test your_email_addr 
should send the date as the body of the email to you.

can checkout archiverTest and then compile and run the tests.

The build.xml file in archiver/archiver works from the command line.
ant clean, then ant build-project creates the runnable files.
ant Archiver then runs FreemindArchiver successfully.
It probably needs lib checked out and possibly something Eclipse,

and then build-project to see if all compiles.
Create another like this for archvierTests and we should be able
to run the tests after a commit also.

Corrected bug in Archiver where a failure to obtain a lock on the log
file caused an exception which then prevented the settings of the 
database url, userid, password, and documentation url.
Now, Version 1_29c uses the -D paramenters if there, but overwrites
them with anything found in the user preferences under .freemind.
Uploaded to VA 10.70.255.115 by emailing from laptop to jwooten37830@gmail.com
then logging into it as administrator/PICIS1231! ( or !1 ), opening
Internet Explorer and downloading the jarfile from there to C:
Edited archiver.bat so that it uses 1_29c and specifies documentation url as
http://localhost/freemind/index.html
----Wed Jun 11 10:26:18 EDT 2014---
uploaded current documentation for Archiver using gmail and installed
on Program Files/aamps/www/freemind and updated index.html to use
correct name for Installation Manual.  Saved old copies to backups
in same directory.  Need to update documents so that they refer to

  DESCRIPTION
  Calculates the age in years

  The calcage package can calculate the age of someone or something in years.
  Internally it uses the datenumber package to calculate the age in days. The
  conversion from days to years is implemented by this package. It is also taken
  care about leap years and such odd things.

Created a web service for motd by creating a dynamic web project
then a class called MotdMonitor in a package.
I then added a method status() which returned hello world.
Added an @WebService annotation to the class and clicked on
generate web service in eclipse.  Selected also to create the web client and test it.
It generated everything and brought up a web page to click "Invoke"
It worked!
Then slowly changed the status method to get the /etc/motd and check
for the connection to mysql.  If ALERT: stuff :ALERT or the mysql
connection is down, then it returns that fact in the xml string
Used the Result.jsp page to figure out what the code was for
getting the service and invoking the status() method.
Created a jsp that did that directly called SampleGetStatus.jsp
It can be run from localhost:8080/motd/Client/sampleMotdMonitorProxy/SampleGetStatus.jsp
Then created a java class in the clent project called TestServiceInvocation
which gets the xml, uses a DOM parser to get the alert message
and prints it out.
I had to add the mysql connection jar to the /lib directory in Tomcat8
in order for the connector to work.
Now I need to create a timer that invokes the service every few minutes
and IF there is an ALERT or MYSQL, it brings up a JOptionPane to inform
the user.  Otherwise it leaves a pulsing green light in the lower right
corner meaning the mysql connection is still alive.
If it goes down, then tell the user to save their file locally and
set hasDatabase to false;
----Mon Nov 10 17:07:10 EST 2014---
Added crack to bin/alias.  Typing crack takes you to the cracking

----Tue Nov 11 12:16:52 EST 2014---
Created BlinkingStatusDemo to blink an icon every second.
Extend and use to display a blinking green filled circle while
connection status is okay. Check status using MotdService every
10 seconds or so.  If ALERT or MYSQL, then display JOptionPane and
change connection status, etc.
----Wed Nov 12 10:04:39 EST 2014---
Created shell script ~/bin/pre_clone.sh which does a mysqldump
of my important databases to /etc/recover.  The script has
a commented out prescription on how to recover the databases
if they don't start automatically when the clone is restored.
I add the script to CCC to create the dumps before cloning
to cloned disk. I need to get a 4 TByte thunderbold drive
and clone barsoom, iTunes, then my mac-book, then Diannes desktop.
It will then go into the safe.  I'll try to do this every week.

Installed a ssh guard by: sudo port install sshguard
It looks at the syslog and if it finds failed ssh authentication errors

----Thu Aug  3 12:19:43 EDT 2017---
Going to drop work on nextdb for now as checked in version works.
The problem appears to be changes in the compiler that don't allow
or interpret differently some of the 'sloppy' coding in nextdb.
Will go back to btree and perhaps ObjDB to see what happens.

cd now works allowing fi lN = baggett after finished loading.  
BUT, if you do a close, then an open and do a ds,
it gets a segmentation fault.  
Might be not doing rewinds, but put them in and didn't fix it.  
Still a problem when saving the database.  
WHY are there two block '2' in the list of buffers?  
one has frozen = -1, others have 0.  
Is the first the associator?  
If so why would there be another block 2 that would overwrite it?
Does assoc block get written out last?  
----Sun Aug 27 16:35:43 EDT 2017---
Created a dumpFile in C that dumps out blocks of a file in hex and ascii.
It assumes the BLOCKSIZE is BUFFSIZE in buffer.h, currently either 2048
or 4096.  This should be a 3rd argument.
Still having problems in that if I cd newdb databases/test/test,
a database is created and performs reasonably well.  However,
cl ( close ) and the op ( open ) it fails doing a ds ( display status )
in that it cannot find the information on file ussage, etc.  Need to 
try to be sure that after doing the cd, I do a flush some way, perhaps CO for
commit, then dumpFile on assoc and data, then compare to what was in the buffers
when I did the db ( debug ) and turned trace on and did buffer asc 2, etc.

Cleaned up a new Makefile that does most of what I want, but doesn't use

Outstanding problems with nextdb are: testRWdata fails on Read Physical

Created a cvs repository project with the name of lib_woo, which
contains the ~woo/lib directory contents.  If it is needed on another machine
then in ~woo, do cvs co lib_woo.  Then compare ~/lib with ~/lib_woo.
Copy any files that are different from lib_woo to lib.  Then delete
lib_woo.  Similarly temporarily rename lib to lib_woo and cd into lib_woo.
Then cvs commit any local changes, then cd .., then rename back to lib.
I believe there is a way to rename as checking out, etc., but this works.

Screwed up on the branch when I made a version in the branch.  Don't do that!
Had to create a branch_170917.tar from tar -cf branch_170917.tar *.[ch],
then saved it .., then cd .., rm -rf nextdb, then back into Eclipse, delete
nextdb project, then use CVS repository explorer to check out HEAD,
then cd nextdb, rm -f *.[ch], then cp branch...tar into nextdb, then
tar -xvf branch_170917.tar to get source files back.  Then had to recover
Makefiles from time machine as they were not checked in!  Finally got
nextdb working and updated HEAD.  Made a tarfile DATE=170923 for safety.

Had to add $(HEADERS) to ~/lib/Makefile.common for TARFILES.  It wasn't

Seem to be getting MOST of fi command working, BUT in a list of fi LN = barry
one isn = 11 shows up that should not be in the list.  It does not appear
to be an off by one error.  It's just wrong.  The entire storing of the
avl isns and retrieval suffer from this mysterious adding and subtracting one.
This really needs cleaning up.  Where does this extra value in FI show up?
ALSO, run testFind and see this list of 44 isns.  The database is closed.  When
it is opened by driver, we see the lastisn = 7.  WTF?  A dump of the assoc
block seems to show that 55 is the lastisn.  Where does this 7 come from? AND,
a logical dump of the database using db logical only shows 3 records! WTF?

Clean up knownhosts on woo-laptop.  It appears to have WAY too many. Can't
ssh from woo-va-air.
----Wed Oct  4 21:03:44 EDT 2017---
I have done an ssh-keygen without a passphrase on woo-va-air.  On each machine
I connect to, I should do a ssh-copy-id remote-server.  Then test with
ssh remote-server.  I guess I repeat in each direction.

Installed FileZilla on barsoom to try to get WordPress to allow installation
using sftp.  sftp already works, so I don't understand.  Does it use
a different port like 2222 instead of 22?  For now, I just deactivated
the reCaptcha plugin as I could not get it to install.

uncompress and install it.

Created a Memo_Template.tex and placed it in ~/Library/TeXShop/Stationery
along with a brief Memo_Template.comment file ( prepared in TeXShop as
a simple text file).  I added the \age function and it allows figures
as a part of it.

Installed time_tracker.tcl and it seems to work with on, off, and other aliases.
Continue to check this out.  on start hacking on project 1 starts the logger.
off stops it and then billing seems to print the billing. time_tracker.tcl and summary should also work.

Rediscovered timelogger, a script I wrote in Perl to keep track of time.
It keeps monthly logs in ~/pers/timelogs.  The command timelogger -,
brings one into an interactive mode to invoice, add, etc.  At present
time, I'm using time_track.tcl and have written a script time_track_report.pl 
that will do the daily, monthly, yearly and client totals. Aliases are
on description @project, and off, which stops billing.
