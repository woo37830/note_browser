Got /Library/WebServer/Documents/Default/library working on laptop.
One html page with jQuery DataTables and EasyUI integrated to create
a library where books are stored (CRUD) in mysql.
Pretty simplistic.

---20160116 15:05:21
Tried formatting index.html from library using tidy.js.  Didn't create
useable code.  Screwed up buttons, etc.  Abandoning this.  Do it manually.

---20160116 15:18:45
Ran /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqldump library --no-data -u root -p > ~/Desktop/library.sql
to create sql file of library.  Moved to barsoom and imported.

---20160116 16:01:17
Run rsync_barsoom.sh to create backup sql scripts of mysql databases
Then run rsync_Seagate_from_barsoom to copy those to Seagate-2

---20160120 12:00:17
To enable screen sharing from command line:
sudo defaults write /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist com.apple.screensharing -dict Disabled -bool false
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist

---20160127 15:06:52
Added library to CVSROOT on barsoom from /Library/WebServer/Documents

---20160129 13:57:01
Downloaded fullPage.js and put into Development/fullPage.js-master
Added folder wooten containing my first changes to learn how to use.
fullPage.js looks good for page navigation that is fixed, i.e. not data driven.
It provides a menu and easy way to set up simple sites.
The README.md has a lot of information about fullPage.js.

---20160130 11:56:37
To start mongo daemon, cd to Development/school-finder, then 
mongod --dbpath ./server/data &
To test, then enter mongo, followed by show dbs.  There should
now be test database, and it is the default.  Do show collecions
and you should see restaurants.  db.restaurants.find().pretty() will
print out that collection.
To start the nodejs application type nodemon ./server/server.js
It should start.  The http://localhost:7777 should give the form to
see the schools and to add or delete schools.  It doesn't seem to
be connected to the mongo database as no schools datab.ase gets created.

---20160214 17:55:01
Addeld an alias fle which means fix line endings.  
Run fle as fle _js/queue/crud.js to fix Mac endings to Unix new lines

---20160217 10:55:43
cd'd to ~/Development/Utilities/enscript-1.6.1 and did configure, make, make install
enscript then installed using above.  Name of default printer found
by lpstat -p, which gave EPSON_Stylus_CX4800___barsoom
Did /usr/sbin/lpadmin -d EPSON_Stylus_CX4800___barsoom, to make that default.
Now lpr file sends file to barsoom printer.
enscript works but alias prt_2up has problems with noclobber and says no such
file or directory and that printer doesn't exist.

---20160218 19:43:54
enscript works when file name is filled in, but not using the \$@.

---20160221 10:36:21
Did brew install watch, which installed into /usr/local/Cellar.
Now watch df -m shows disk usage updated every 2 seconds.
watch -n 10 script.sh will run script.sh every 10 seconds.

---20160221 17:03:47
Ripped Firefly 14 episodes to ~/Movies.
Firefly then copied from ~/Movies to barsoom:/Volumes/iTunes/Movies
Firefly then rsync'd back to Seagate TimeCapsule-2/Movies from barsoom
Firefly imported into barsoom iTunes.

---20160223 11:11:39
Downloaded sqlmap and moved to ~/Development/Utilities.
sqlmap is a tool for testing for sql injection problems with databases.
sqlmap usage is python sqlmap.py -u "http://jwooten37830.com/demo.html?id=1" --batch
which would send the query to the demo.html page with the parameter id=1
and later you could try where you put something in to check sql injection.

---20160227 15:11:15
Tried to install pyAudio for PersonalAssistant in Python.

Have mumps in /usr/local/bin and I've run it from ~/Development/vista
Where the data and keys are kept when you run from there?
I created two mumps subroutines ^DEMO and hello, and run ZLOAD to load them'
But, mumps doesn't then seem to know about them.  There is also
a mumps vistadb and startvista and runvista, but they don't work
How to execute a subroutine in mumps and how to list it?

Moved /opt/local/bin/*-config to ~/Desktop/Folders/opt-bin-configs in order
to get brew to upgrade and also had to remove the --config from the brew update.
After that, brew worked to install ical-buddy.  Now icalBuddy runs
without errors.  Oh, I had to change ownership of /user/local to woo:admin

---20160519 16:16:38

Installed RoR using sudo gem install rails
Getting ready to install Ansible, so set number of forks to unlimited, viz
sudo launchctl limit maxfiles unlimited, (Set forks unlimited)

---20160701 11:56:39
You have to have command line developer tools on OS X El Capitan
xcode-select --install
If pip is not installed, then:
   easy_install --user pip
   Add Python 2.7 user bin directory to PATH by:
   printf 'if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then\n source ~/.bashrc\nfi\n' >> $HOME/.profile
   printf 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Library/Python/2.7/bin\n' >> $HOME/.bashrc
   source $HOME/.profile
Verify the pip command is part of the path
pip --version
Install ansible via pip
pip install --user ansible --upgrade
Verify successful installation of Ansible components
ansible --version
Create a system-wide Ansible directory
sudo mkdir /etc/ansible
Copy the default Ansible configuration file to the system-wide Ansible directory
sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/andsible/devel/examples/ansible.cfg -o /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
Verify using local host as the target
ansible localhost -m ping
ansible localhost - setup -a 'filter-ansible_distribution'
ansible localhost -a 'uname -a'
My /etc/ansible/hosts is:
[local]
127.0.0.1 ansible_connection=local

Raise open file descriptors value for Ansible > 2.x for OS X
launchctl limit maxfiles ( will be 256 probably )
sudo launchctl limit maxfiles 1024 unlimited
launchctl limit maxfiles
ulimit -n
Create Ansible Inventory and Playbooks ( see binarynature.blogspot.com/2016/01/install-ansible-on-os-x-el-capitan_30.html

olution is pretty easy; Add the library path in your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile file:

MYSQL=/usr/local/mysql/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$MYSQL
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/mysql/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
If it is still not working (this work for me):

Cloned MX HD at 7:18?
Then did disk format, then reinstall El Capitan as ralph
Then migration assistant to recover Appliations and woo, but not "other files"
Then moved all .bash files to bash files to take them out of boot up or login path.
Then logged in as woo.  Noted that /usr/local had only var directory
and /opt had nothing left of ports or fink.
Then checked ruby was installed.  Then move .rvm directory to .rvm.bak
Then did a Time Machine backup at 0800 AM on Monday 20160718.  This has 
new El Capitan and not contaminations from ports and fink, I think.
Now to reinstall all of the rails environment before I try to recover
my .bashrc and .bash_profile paths.  Then look into fortran, and forth, etc.

---20160719 15:25:26
Had a rails environment working at 20160719 11:19.  Without prompt

Downloaded marc4J, but couldn't get all xml stuff to work.  Have entire
marc4J download in marc4J.clone and can move part of it in slowly.
The examples/.../ReadMarcExample and WriteMarcExample both work.
Need to check that it is doing what the PL/1 code expects.

---20160824 17:02:14
Got xml portion of marc4j into marc4JXml and it compiles and works.
Added the examples directory with my read and write codes.
The tests appear to be testing against other files.  ***DONE***

Wrote ReadWriteUnicodeExample to show writing out Korean hangul as UTF8 encoded bytes
then dumping that file in hex, then reading it back in and displaying it in Hangul Font.
Not clear what LoC uses the koreane3, etc. files for though.  They don't have the 
unicode values for the UTF8 characters in the table.
