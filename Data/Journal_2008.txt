---20080214

	1)  Requested copies of latest versions of documents on BCL from Dale.
	2)  Requested copies of any examples of artifacts used in BCL.  She stated that
		a template had been created to get certain information during project definition, but that 
		it had been rejected and "open format" was acceptable.  Question is how to collect the minimal
		data that can be used as metrics.
	3)  Received BCL 071203 breifing BCL 101 from Suzanne
	4)  Received Draft BCL Operations Guide 20081212 from Dale.
	5)  Turned papers over to Richard Nagel who checked, completed, and will deliver them to

---20080218 19:30:44

---20080219
	
	1)  Gave presentation to Paul Ketrick and others.  Some difficulty at first as he did not
		see why I was looking into capability cases and thought it might take forever.  I said
		that we would take the 6 projects that are being considered as the first part of
		BCL and define the capabilities each is using, and then work to gather metrics on
		those capabilities.  Then see if there is overlap, information that can be used to
		predict success, etc.  During discussion of SOA, my experience seemed to matter as he
		now wants me to go to some of the technology meetings to present some good questions
		to keep things on track.
	2)  Mike Boler came by and suggested I talk to Keith Gibbons ( 2 down hall and to the
		left) about EVA and tools.
	3)  Mike also suggested I talk to Tom Lennox and say that Prishantha and Mike Boler
		suggested I speak with him about ERP implementation.
	4)  Get with Mary about ADM and Paze earned value metrics?
	5)  Talk to Kevin O'Connor about business cases.
	6)  Talk to Art Holland across from me about the current stages of investements.
		Successes might be Navy ERP, NAV, ENoVa, BSM is considered a success, what about
		EI information.
	7)  I received Ron Wilsons EA guide which has tons of questions.  What do I think about
		it?
		

---20080219

	1)  In at 0800 - Dana escorted me upstairs.
	2)   Out at 1700 - emailed ppt to jEdwards to review.  Add and see if I can discuss with
		Nagel tomorrow.
		

---20080220

	1)  In at 0830 - Richard Nagel escorted me up.  Discussed briefly the idea of collecting
		a suite of capability cases from which project originators would select.  These would have
		screen shots, data about configuration, ordering, training, etc.  that would allow
		us to then create reliable estimates of time to deploy.
	2)  Met Donna.  So I have Dale, Suzanne, Richard, Donna, and X beside me who got an explanation
		of SOA from Randy, whom I've not met.  


---20080223 18:17:41
compiled ddmmyy.c and replaced it.  Need to get rid of scripts to manage the
science NeXT machines.  Found quarto.c, compiled it and got it working.  Need
to learn how to insert the file in the middle of the piped commands.
Also got model and minuit plotting.


---20080225

	1)  Downloaded grw1-01 and expanded it.  It is a very simple report writer written in
		Java.  I had to fix one subscript range at line 723, but otherwise okay.
	2)  Amazingly, you can run the line of script from the shell script in the terminal 
		window in the same directory as the shell script and it works, but if you execute
		the shell script it can't find the file!
	3)  I'd change so that there was a generic report file, rather than creating one in each
		database.  Have the name of the database as one of the columns.  Running a report would
		mean selecting a database.
	

---20080303

	1)  Arrived 8AM, escorted in by Dale Erikson.  Call Richard Nagel on Tues, Dale won't be in.
	2)  Had discussion with Paul Ketrick about OHIO and SOA.  I need to review each of these
		and the proposed diagrams to create a pithy summary of what each is and where and
		why they are used.  The data warehouse and data views with canned queries is not
		actually what is thought of as SOA.
	3)  Have times set up for Kevin O'Connor at 1330 on Tues 3/4/2008
		and                   Keith Gibbons  at 0930 on Fri  3/7/2008
		
	4)  Created Kema and Deep6 080303 and put to .mac.  Things seemed to work like they
		should.
	
 

---20080304

	1)  Worked from apartment downloading document from site given by Richard.  Could not
		download at BTA as have no connection and Sprint cell connection is very poor.
	2)  Also reviewed SOA and OHIO to prepare for discussions.  For SOA, it is apparent
		that it is the "granularity" of the service that is important.  Too small, and
		there are so many that they can't be managed or aggregated very well.  Too large
		and there is no opportunity for re-use, plus the interfaces keep getting juggled
		as the requirements change.  What is important is to find those reusable 
		capabilities and package those as services depending upon the recognized business
		process needs.  Continually look for abstractions that can create re-useable
		services that can be managed.
	3)  Met with Kevin O'Connor -1330 to discuss programs coming under BCL initially.
		See Documents/Programs/BTA/Meetings/080304-KevinO'Connor.txt for notes.
	4)  Discussed meeting with Richard Nagel who corrected some impressions and really
		liked the idea of capability cases up front that tied the program into BEA and FEA.
	5)  Received my building pass ( drivers license and pilots certificate ), but only good 
		through April 2008.  Nagel and I are working on starting renewal part.  Probably tied
		up with my contract funding.  Also CAC card being processed.  I have to do
		phone interview to get that and then go to Thompson building and get card.  That will
		leave only the clearance part and we might tie that to badge renewal?
	6)  Typed up notes on meeting and filed them.  Forwarded via email to John E.
	7)  Created new Deep6 and Kema, tested, then uploaded to .mac.  Charles seemed
		pleased with the product.  
		

---20080305

	1)  Can use the RFQ needed.  Select configuration I want.
	2)  Call the BTA Help Desk when I get my CAC card and they will bring up
		a default PC to get me set up and running.  Call 607-3922 when ready.
	3)  Send Squeak to Tom.
	4)  Breve is a boids like evolving mechanism.  An object learns to walk
		aninimals learn to flock together, etc.  It is a simulation tool.
	

---20080306

	1)	Form Ref - 711709 Comcast 1-866-804-4303
	2)  8:30 - 11:30 - putting together computer equip list.
	3)  Moved from 10th floor to 4th floor, room 409.
	4)  Went through CAC card with Gloria and Suzanne took me there.
	5)  Received word that CAC card approved, and will go to Pentagon on Friday
		to pick it up.
	6)  Forwarded final equipment list to John E. for his report.
	

---20080307

	1)  7:30-9:00 Pentagon to get CAC card
	2)  9:00-9:30 getting PC setup originally with CAC card
	3)  9:30-10:30 meeting with Keith about tools used in BCL
	4)  10:30-11:30 Emails regarding software ( Visio ), badging, and clearance.
	5)  11:30-5:00 Working on creating list of software forinstallation on
			lab computers for simulation.
