Backed up woo_laptop to partition woo_laptop at 13:30.

---20180101 17:18:17
Backed up barsoom and iTunes finishing at 1718

---20180122 16:52:10
Copied indecks from woo-laptop to barsoom /Library/Server/Web/Sites/Default/Data/indecks
Changed so that Safari bookmark for Journal goes there and Development/indecks goes local.

---20180517 10:25:13
Installed time_tracker.tcl and it seems to work with on, off, and other aliases.
Continue to check this out.  on start hacking on project 1 starts the logger.
off stops it and then billing seems to print the billing. time_tracker.tcl and summary should also work.

Got a contract from Quantellia and stored it on Evernote.

Created a link in ~/Development to the Perl directory in ~/Development/Forth/Perl

---20180606 21:05:27
Created time_track_report in ~/Development/Perl and got pattern matching working.

---20180607 16:26:02
Installed Text-CSV using ppm from /usr/local/ActivePerl-5.14/bin/ppm install Text-CSV
Create an alias that points to this ppm

---20180618 13:15:25
Imported old base config from Dropbox/Personal/Reference/John's Time Capsule.baseconfig #router #setup #internet

---20180621 11:32:02
Rediscovered timelogger, a script I wrote in Perl to keep track of time.
It keeps monthly logs in ~/pers/timelogs.  The command timelogger -,
brings one into an interactive mode to invoice, add, etc.  At present
time, I'm using time_track.tcl and have written a script time_track_report.pl 
that will do the daily, monthly, yearly and client totals. Aliases are
on description @project, and off, which stops billing.

---20180628 14:14:30
Created ~/bin/m6.data and put test01.m6 in it.  Copied m6 app from ~/Development/OlderSoftware/m6 and tested it.  DF doesn't work.

docker run --name sql_server_demo -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=Fester.123' -p 1433:1433 microsoft/mssql-server-linux

---20180722 22:54:43
Continue to debug present version of Validate using DateTable.

---20180804 15:26:52
Created dups which takes the name of a csv file and checks for account
number duplicates in the first column.  Tested using check.csv and
checkdup.csv ( where I cat'd the last one of check.csv onto
itself and created checkdup.csv using
tail -n 1 check.csv 
 cat - check.csv > checkdup.csv

---20180830 21:25:52
Signed documents for contract revision.
Need to submit invoices for these.

---20180902 21:21:13
Need to add writing all failed validations, loads, queries to separate
files like BREValidations.report, BREAccountsLoader.report, and queryEngine.report and include those in the scan for attachments in EndState.

---20180918 13:55:26
Moved Projects/erc-caml/bre/data to Seagate-TimeCapsule-2 to free
up space on woo-laptop.  These are example data files that get copied
to the monitoring directory when making test runs.
Also move Development/VirtualMachines to Seagate-TimeCapsule-2
since I don't use them much and need more free space on woo-laptop.

---20181029 13:36:20
Today, I am moving .diary to Dropbox/Personal/Documents/Notes/.diary and 
added a soft link from .diary to there.  This way it should work across my devices.
I am also doing the same thing with my .todo and .time_track/time_track.txt

---20181030 14:36:13
Had WebEx yesterday and spoke with David Kovar on project URSA.
They apparently have not done any correlation analysis on their foo3.csv data.
I extracted the first 500 rows into first500.csv and put it into
Numbers on iCloud drive.  The foo3.csv is in Projects/ursa/data.
Telemetry occurs at 2.4 GHz and video at 5ish GHz.
Nadine says they want to select 12 variable and "time-fold" them
after determining an appropriate folding time, like 10 secs.
Need to set up R and tmux again so it will work. 

---20181102 09:40:47
Moved .diary to ~/Dropbox/Personal/Notes/.diary so all machines can share.  
Got ursa-aws instance named JohnWooten yesterday.  Installed linuxbrew and tmux yesterday.
Noted that today ursa-aws alias doesn't work.  Need permanent ip name. put in .tmux.conf and !/bin/alias

---20181106 12:28:48
Had WebEx with URSA.  Each row is 1/60 sec.  Active period of sure RF impingment is 1.5 seconds
with 1 sec of uncertainty on each side.  Altitude may be centimeters?  Plot altitude versus diff(altitude)
Slope of tx and rx values, track average of that.  Active period would be 90 rows.  Fold 15 slide 5?  Fold 30 slide 10?
Thermal effects might follow 2-5 seconds after impingement.

---20181106 17:31:11
Had Xfinity guy, Tim, over.  He reset and turned on bridge mode.  Suggested
that we buy our own modem without WiFi.  Appears that the TimeCapsule might be bad.
Exchange it before the warranty is gone.  Back it up first.

---20181107 19:53:26
Checked that could decrypt BR file using secret key.  gpg QP_D_BR_20181102
Then used FileZilla to move secret key up to Azure.  BREValidator.exe worked and decrypted
BR file and output queries.  Then started MaestroLite.  It appears to pass the passPhrase along
as needed.  For some reason, not seeing any output from the Loader.  Will check tomorrow on this.

---20181107 19:56:09
Backing up the John's Time Capsule to the 4 Tbyte drive.  Then will erase it and return to Apple
and get new Time Capsule.  Set it up and see if it works.  Then clone Data back to the new one.

---20181111 19:48:03
Got the DataTable to work, but sorter buttons not showing.
Hid two columns and can't get the PDF button to show.
Add more to the Maestro web-app, like start, Set mode? set what-if?                  
Be able to start each app separately with args.
Finish figuring out the Azure Key Store.

---20181112 13:16:38
It appears that the order really mattered in the DataTables.  putting things at the top helped.
See MVC_Maestro.cs especially ViewFile.cshtml.  Now to try another theme?

---20181113 14:43:34
pushed Maestro into remote repository branch web_app.  Need to figure out how to put csv items
into json array, and then use jslinq to manipulate them.
Other work is currently in tweak-reporting

---20181220 12:01:52
Checked out fix-sftp from repository.  Made some debugging changes.
Ran Build 171 which only does 2000 dialer mode values and removed 
the twisty sort and NEV ordering logic for testing.

---20181220 13:05:23
Created new version with no limit on rows. Build 172.  Still has
the removal of all the sorting and ordering.

---20181220 13:11:57
Replaced that with build 173 after fixing missing phone number message

---20181221 18:02:41
Sftp.cs had the ex.Message.  Corrected, commited, and pushed.
FixZip was there but possibly executable wasn't pushed to caml-dev2
Pushed MaestroLite and queryEngine to caml-dev2, woo37830/apps/*

---20181230 18:57:34
Installed SignalR under ~/Projects/erc-caml.  Need to run some of the 
examples and make sure that I can broadcast messages between web interface
and all of the processes.  Then figure out the Status, etc. and create
some tests of starting and stopping processes and reporting them 
from the web server.
