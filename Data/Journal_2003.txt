1)  Moved all codes from Wonderland to USB Drive
2)  Cleaned up build.xml and run.bat for
a) Development/Producer
b) Development/ClassMetrics
3)  TODO** reset the bat files for jakarta and test
deployment of the Producer.
4) Add RESULT_OBJ to QueueEntry
5) add printout of resultObj in toString of QueueEntry
6) Make the database the Access one for testing
7) Change RESULT_OBJ to 255 for testing.
8) Appears to enqueue and requeue with the addition of the new response.
**TODO** not queueing to next user correctly.
a)  Need to retain present state.
b)  Need to get next user from next State
c)  Need to provide a split function where queueEntry
splits, marking original completed, new children as active.
requeue works as normal UNTIL it hits a join.  It then
looks at the join policy to see whether to advance or not.
Design work here would be useful.
Can I put the data on a file and refer to it?  Would be better
perhaps.  Add functions to clean up entries and remove data if
all job steps are completed and we are deleting.

---20030120
1)  d:\Development\Projects\Producer now runs as before using Tomcat.
Login in "http://localhost:8080/producer_v5/login.htm"
user: woo
password: doofus
2)  ***TODO***
a)  Need to indicate which jsp's and classNames don't exist when
viewing them in the Product_Maint
e.g. in Looking at a process there are activities.
one of the activities is Create_Activity
It shows using a jsp of create_activity.jsp (it didn't exist).
b)  Need to run a list of TODO from product maint at any level that
shows what is referred to but not implemented or completed.
c)  Finish the create process, create Activity, ... so I can
add a new process, activity, outcome, etc.
d)  Where do I stand on the data-containers.  Can I view them, edit them
etc?
e)  Show name of product on each screen.  i.e. if working in Test
then Product: Test should showup on the screen
f)  remove_user.jsp doesn't compile.

---20030131
1)  Added using hyper links to go to interesting pages rather than so many
buttons.  Only on view_process page so far.
2)  Added visible attribute to actions.  If not visible, don't show up
on pages.
3) *** TODO ***
a) Clean up some pages to look like view process
b) add additional links to jsp's, containers, etc.
c) Be sure visible gets saved in BPWriter.

---20030205
1)  Added new Edit to allow looking at all processes, activities, etc.
2)  Changed old Product Maint to Wizard which works as before.
3)  list_of_products.jsp doesn't work yet. ** TODO **
4)  Checked in the version.
5)  Create v6 with new UserBroker that reads and writes from a file. ** TODO **
6)  Make some of the pages use container to view attributes
a)  Can I have a generic container that if one isn't supplied, but
an object is, it creates and uses reflection to fill?
7)  NEED to get ability to create product, create process, add activity, set
container for activity, etc.  ** TODO **
8)  Run tests of SC_Framework!!! ** TODO **

---20030220
1)  SC_Producer fails with null pointer getting instance when logging in.
2)  How to build SC_Framework so it goes into repository? ** Done maven jar:install ***
3)  How to build SC_Producer so it uses that. ** Done use the jar in the product.xml **
4)  How to get ssh to work
5)  Producer not working now with maven creation.
6)  Spend weekend looking at gui for viewing workflow. ( depends on 5? ).
7)  Get tags for tables, etc. and see how to adapt.

---20030221
1)  Working on:
a)  Producer - moved into maven.  Testing
b)  SC_Framework - moved into maven. Testing
c)  SC_Producer - moved into maven.  Testing
d)  WorkFlowEditor - moved into maven.  Changing to use Producer xml files
2)  Plan
a)  Spend 1 hour on Producer, tracking down why Containers aren't being
filled from the route or the input data.
b)  Write lots of tests for Containers, and other pieces so that I'm sure
they work like they should.  Why don't tests run correctly?  Is it
class path again?  Why doesn't maven handle this?
c)  Write a Scheduler class that runs as an application and wakes up every
15 minutes to handle Queues.
d)  Should JobStepId be the name of a class that gets instantiated and has
an interface QueueAction that has a method evaluate taking a QueueEntry?  At least allow by having an attribute on QueueEntry
for JobStepIdIsExecutable?
e)  Write test for Scheduler so that we put something in WAIT status, that 
gets serviced and changed by Scheduler.  Also escalate?
f)  Write a simple server that takes Tasks and queues them to users
or roles.  Can I use this as something from maven?  
g)  How to get my "maven" server and "tracking" server running?  Ask
Brandon?  I love the Werks problem tracker, etc.

---20030309
1) Lost Jira database, had to reinstall.  Apparently Pcpi crashed and took down the database.  *** Get new key from Jira and then export after installing data again ***.
2) Redid versions of sc_core (3.2), sc_expeditor (3.1), sc_regulator(3.1),
sc_queueing(3.1), sc_workflow(3.1), workflowEditor(3.1),
and sc_wfserver.  *** TODO actions and activities are not changing
name!!!. screens don't redraw correctly. ***.

---20030401
1) Queue is now able to save formData and restore it using QueueData class.
2) Data is passed from activity to activity by being mapped in the Action
from one container to the next.  If there is no overlap of names
then a mapping needs to be defined. *** TODO ***
This should provide the oldname->newName mapping.
Store in datacontainer file as mappings.
read them in and store them.  Refer to them by name from actions.
3) Create Container editor that allows browsing containers, and creating new ones plus mappings.  *** TODO ***
4) Create the  bar chart view of the queue and use for customs.
look in the hologix files (mba) for the plotter. *** TODO ***
5) Think about persistence.  I.e. how to map containers to sql
and how to read them in.

1) Massive revision to remove Hashtable args and replace with
IRequest, ISession, and singleton IApplicationContext.
2) All of Swing works except start new process doesn't find initial activity.  Check again for hash.

---20030618
1)  D:\jakarta\JBoss-2.4.1_Tomcat-3.2.3\tomcat\bin
2)  dbl click on startup
3)  Be sure the usb drive is mapped to E:
4)  Seems to work.  Doesn't have new navigation
5)  Need to recompile pcpi and move classfiles to new web location
6)  Need to set it to run from D drive

---20030628
1)  Dependents needs "Done" leading to EndState.
2)  Employee List frame needs to be slightly shorter so Filter will
be exposed.
3)  SalaryHistory doesn't work.
4)  Why doesn't Deduction code show up in All Deductions or Deposits?  It shows up in goals.  Possibly a route in the xml?
5)  Not adding state taxes.
6)  Local not adding
DIAGNOSTIC---Thread[Thread-9,5,main]---SuperUser---&PI--- Message: RuleUtils.getValFromObj() = First Attempt: Reflection failed for method getExtraTaxType on class com.Shoulders.taxes.TaxLocal
WARNING---Thread[Thread-9,5,main]---SuperUser---&PI--- Message: RuleUtils.getValFromObj() = Second Attempt: Reflection failed for method extraTaxType on class com.Shoulders.taxes.TaxLocal
7)  YTDController seems to be missing the xml or html YTDAccum
8)  ManualCheckCreate workflow needs to be examined.  After selecting
an employee, entering check number, then next gets no page.
9)  AddUnscheduledPayroll failed to build screen.
10) SelectPayrollSchedule not binding?
11) View/Edit user not finding html and xml for ChangeUserPassword, BUT
this should be a servlet for listing users, then selecting and 
editing their passwords, profiles, etc.
12) Under Utilities, edit user should have a Done to get rid of process.

---20030914
1)  Review Tomcat4.0 to try to move anything necessary to 4.1
a)  newTabs - has lots of stuff on new tabs and jsps.
seems to be mixed up with struts config
doesn't work, but tabs are there and a GOOD FormCheck.js
This is backed up on USB drive and on CD
b)  pcpi - crashed server and browser
c)  Producer - crashed server and browser
2)  JBoss/Tomcat
a)  pcpi - works except edit user fails.
b)  pcpi-new is same as pcpi, do a diff sometime
3)  Tomcat4.1
a)  pcpi - seems to have problems with jsp locations or paths.
** Fixed main.jsp
** took j2ee and servlet out of lib.  Tomcat was complaining.
** manualcheck, unscheduledpayroll servlets?
** edit user - check screen
** quickCalc has problem with qcwhatif.jsp
** need to find and load a payroll schedule
b)  sc_wfserver - tries to show 1.0.jsp - out of date statemachine?
c)  ServletStateMachineContainer - out of date
d)  jstatemachine-1.0 - nice demo of complex state machine and
auto handling of states.
4)  bat - can't unlock.  I like the screen layouts.  Will try to adapt
Requirements traceability to it.
5)  RequirementsTraceability - needs to be able to generate
a) sc-workflow
b) ace- workflow
c) jstatemachine-1.0 workflow
6)  I like datamanipulation and formproc.  How to adapt to shoulders?
7)  ace statemachine has flaw in handling roles.  If user does not
have destination role, what happens?
8)  Clean up shoulders statemachine to look like ace, use loaders, actions,
etc?  I really want to get the elements and datamanipulation in.
9)  Best bet so far is to start working in 4.1 to make pcpi perfect.
back feed changes in jsps, etc. to project
look at how to integrate datamanipulation into sc
Does jstatemachine-1.0 queue? could it?
Do a review of all sc_code to see that wf_editor, wf_server, etc.
all work consistently.

---20030919
1)  Got Manual Checks working, but there seems to be a TaxFrequency missing from
several jsps or servlets that prevent using the taxes, deductions, etc.
2)  Payroll schedule doesn't seem to be loading ,but gives no error.  When
moving to schedule a payroll, it hangs.
3)  Need to review the html.XXX servlets to see which ones need to be added
to the web.xml

---20030920
1)  Train_6 is under Program Files/eclipse/workspaces/burrt_Train_6_laptop
2)  Got part of new look by changing main.jsp to main_hsd.jsp and
using main_tree.jsp as main.jsp.  Not getting nav tree up though
error in navigationtree.jsp?  EmployeeList?
3)  QuickCalc isn't showing up the quickCalc for some reason.  Trace this down.
4)  Need to write a process(?) that 
a)  select a pay batch
b)  create the items that QuickCalc needs as input
c)  run QuickCalc on those items
d)  print out a summary page showing number of checks
total wages, total taxes, etc.
e)  print out each employees check and "stub" to an html file?
f)  "print checks", "review"...
Write this as a servlet?  keep giving control back to it for now with
different actions?  I can write as a demo program in Eclipse and
then feed data in servlet?
a)  get paydatabatch, get linked list of employees
for each employee, get their payroll agreement and the
current amounts, etc.
fill in QC info for that employee.  get the employees
ytd from the payroll agreements ytd.
b)  At end if we agree to print, etc. update the check history,
update the ytd, etc.
How do we launch a servlet as opposed to a jsp or html page?
5)  In Tomcat 3.2 QC works, but doesn't calculate taxes ritht.  Does do something
for married 1 exemption, but not federal
6)  Check out listdetailsalaryhistory in both versions.

---20030926
1)  Downloaded hibernate and middlegen.
a)  Tested middlegen with mySQL and got it to show tables for queuedb
b)  Generatd ejbs for those tables!
c)  ***TODO*** look at how to use these with mySQL
2)  Looked at QuickCalc.  The test uses a "hand-wired" calling sequence, while
the process collects the data, puts it into a QuickCalcInput, 
calls some calculate, the reads from QuickCalcOutput.
***TODO*** I need to create test case that does exactly what
the process does, then modify it to read from a pay batch(possibly get clue here from createpayfile).

---20031024
1)  View/Edit User doesn't work.  Appears to be for changing password. 
Just remove it since it can come from the Security tab anyway?

---20031026
1)  View/Edit - Learned that DefaultActivity.jsp causes the defaultActivity seervlet to be run.  IF you change this to runRalph, it will come up with error "pcpi/runralph" not found.
2)  So, DefaultActivity causes defaultactivity servlet to run, using the next field which is "serverwindow" and should be the name of the HTML file.
3)  Still can't get logging to work.  Somehow have to get this first.  Then might could track down the error.
4)  Removed the ChangeUserPassword.html file, have a Copy of .  Still gives same error.  Might be standard error when either not found or error.
****TODO**** Get logging working!!!!
All this in tomcat 4.1.xx.
5)  Can't log into sc-wfserver in tomcat 4.1.xx.  Says userId and password aren't correct, but anything should work.  Prints out null, null for them in message, but they are correct in request.  Need to recompile this project and check it out, perhaps from swing also.

---20031209
1)  Received call from Iyless Aircraft in Tulsa.  They will do
engine rebuild for:
$14562.47 which includes parts, materials, labor. plus
$1500.00 pull and hang engine.
That's a complete overhaul with guides replaced, new pistons, rings, hoses,
camshaft, bearings, etc.  vacuum pump, prop governor, and prop not overhauled.
Cylinders will be to spec, new intake and exhaust valves, etc.
