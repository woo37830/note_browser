I'm going to try out the dictation feature. It's the first entry in my notes 2013 file.

1/1/13

Added notify to ~/bin as notify.sh Title Message
Added notify alias to .alias so that notify Alert Time_Machine_Backup_Failed
	would send an alert like that.  Note no spaces in title or message.
Need to go through logs on barsoom and if it Time Machine doesn't do backup
	send an alert.  Means copying terminal-notifier.app to barsoom.
	TODO

Use osascript, for example:

osascript -e 'tell app "Finder" to display dialog "Hello World"' 

Can also use "Messages", but not yet to someone.

1/3/13

tell application "Messages"
	send "OK" to buddy "dianne37830@me.com" of service "E:jwooten37830@me.com"
end tell

This in the applescript editor sends the message "OK" to dianne.  Can't seem to send one to myself yet, however.

1/3/13

Created a workflow using Mail/New Reminders Item.
Add to: Existing List: Work
due date: 1/3/2013 ( how to change )
Alarm message with sound basso
the same day at 12:00 ( how to change ).

Saved as RemindMe.workflow into ~/bin ( had proper mod )

Ran automator -i Fix_it RemindMe.workflow 

AND it put a reminder Fix_it into my work reminders!  We'll see what it does.

Anyway, Now I might have a way to put up a note about something needing to be checked.

Also created a shell script reminder.sh in ~/bin

#!/bin/bash
osascript - title <<END
on run a
tell app "Reminders"
tell list "Reminders" of default account
make new reminder with properties {name:item 1 of a}
end
end
end
END

running it as reminder.sh Some_title

creates a reminder in Reminders list, but not setting the title.

Got cvs working inside Juno, needed to get ssh working without passwords between
client and server first.  Then was a piece of cake.
Found a way to use automate -i title RemindMe.workflow to create a reminder.
Also a script reminder.sh that does similarly.  Need to work on these.
Have barsoom as master and xanadu as slave for database automatic replication.

TODO-20120107:1200(C) Finish writing the script to add info to Notes_2012 and
    to move data to Calendar(C) or Reminders(R). Only put there if TODO followed by

Added the AppleScript to auto empty trash to ~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts
    then selected .Trash command/Shift/G and selected Services
    and clicked on Folder Actions and selected AutoEmpty.scrpt 
    Tested and it appears to work.  When something added to Trash
    it will check and throw away something older until under 2G.  If item
    itself is larger than 2G, then it asks if you wish to delete it.
    If not, puts on desktop.  Also installed this on va_air.

---20130109 12:00:19
Added reminder script to geek scripts to put reminders on screen.
Need to put headings for different groups.

---20130110 13:52:42
Turned off replication on barsoom and xanadu.  Made export of mm_prod
    and placed into Dropbox/Shoulders for upload to V8.
Might look into rsync as a way to nightly move database dumps to xanadu
    and load them there with mysqladmin script.

    Working with some things that need updating and removing that

---20130115 14:00:09
Got helloWorld exported as warfile to /Library/Tomcat/webapps
    Has a servlet called Dispatcher, edited web.xml to
    set up so that http://localhost:8080/helloWorld/dispatcher
    would bring up jsp/helloWorld.jsp which has 2 items added
    to the request and shown in css table.

---20130116 16:53:28
Reviewing use of xml and xslt's.  
    Found that opening ~/Documents/Reference/FEA/srm/FEA_XML_Doc_Rev_1.2.xml
    in the Safari browser produces a fully formatted document with hyperlinks
    and formatting. Use this as a model for how to do formatting
    perhaps in a jsp?

---20130116 17:46:58
Set up beginning of rsync and backup scripts
    ~/bin/scripts/rsync_01.sh will maintain sync between host and xanadu
    ~/bin/scripts/remote_backup_bin_01.sh will clean out tarfiles older
        than 7 days in the ~/backups/woo_laptop/tarfiles directory
        and then put the compressed ~/bin in as a dated tar.gz
    Add a list of files to the rsync_01.sh and loop through them to
        keep that fileset synchronized.

---20130116 17:58:24
A single line rsync into a single directory, for instance keeping
    two user directories synced would be
    rsync -avzR --log-file=tmp/rsync.loc -e ssh data dumps pers woo@xanadu.local:/Users/woo/tmp
    This put the directories data, dumps, and pers into tmp for testing.
    If it was several directories in the users home directory
    then they could be synced with the users home directory on the slave.

---20130116 18:15:59
rsync_01.sh now does a list of FILES.  This could be used to 
    move myql dump files from mysqldump to backup where they would then
    be loaded using the script.

---20130118 12:34:03
Installed jstl jars into Tomcat 7 lib directory
    Tested using xform.jsp in helloWorld and the style.xsl in styles.
    It worked fine.  It proves also that I can have several sets of
    xml and different or same xsl transforms on the same page.
    Can it be combined with css, probably.  Will test.

---20130118 13:22:29
Created two templates in style.xsl, one for books and one for non-fiction-books
    Then in xform.jsp had an xml section for books and one for non-fiction-books
    The transforms then applied the css to both tables if I put at the top
    the window.onload function with altRows('fiction') and 'non-fiction';

sc_statemachine has Login class that can support different authenticators
    specified in the config file sc_workspace/sc_test/conf/sc_wfserver01.cfg

---20130118 14:51:04
It appears that the TestApplication.java in sc_statemachinetests
    receives the event when the transition is made from the create
    state to the list state.  Right now, it is printing out a message
    but it appears that it could queue the item and its data ( xml )
    and mark the previous queue entry as completed. TODO

---20130118 15:09:25
TODO - Consider in ModelTests putting the xml string containing
    the person information into the environment as attribute
    xmlPerson.  The the process can carry around a compound
    xml document that contains person, address, orders, etc.
    When the queue entry is writen out, the xml is written to
    a file in  a data directory.  The path to the file
    is stored into the queue entry as the data field.
    Clicking on a queue entry reconstitutes the state and
    appplies the states xsl to the data to render what is 
    desired on the screen.

Copied part of the bash book in Reference/Unix Books/Bash Scripts
    that covered the coloring of the comman line into ~/bin/prompt.sh
    But it doesn't do the colors right and some of the commands
    aren't in Mac OS X.  Fixed a few, but still there.

---20130120 21:50:03
Added a /etc/motd to put up a special notice
    Fixed the colors showing in the This is BASH by using \x1B instead
    of \e ( just in the echo command, apparently )
    Then fixed the display of the PS1, but need to check the
    indication of suspended jobs.
    Not sure about the su to root as it doesn't show up the same info
    Also, do I need this on the remote machines?  How does ssh show it?

 I built a new server with iis for the CST.  The new server is
10.70.134.165   (VHAV08PICCST).  This server would be dedicated to just
CST.   I put all the users that were on 134.146.  Need to try it out.
2.  on both the Old Server (134.146) and the new (134.165),  I placed a
folder called "Shortcut to CST" which will allow you to switch files
from the old to the new.  You will be able to store files in the folder
since it is on a SAN and backed up.  
3.  John,  you have internet access on this server.  Go ahead and
download and install PHP.  I have never dealt with PHP and have no clue
what to do.  No reason to wait on me for that.  Also, download MySQL.
The VA only has Microsoft SQL.

Had thought to create services ( probably using NetBeans )
    1)  getUsersApplicationsAndProcesses
        returns xml with applications and processes user can initiate
    2)  getUsersTasks
        returns xml with tasks user can service
    3)  startProcess
        initiates a process given user token, application, process, organization
    4)  deQueueProcess
        dequques a process from the tasks and present screen
    5)  advanceProcess
        takes process id, usertoken, xml of data from form
        and event name and advanes the process.
    6)  authenticate
        takes user token and determines if it is still valid.  
        If not, asks for reauthentication.  Updates token after
        checking if user is still a valid user.

    Now, web pages are mostly jsp, presenting xml, calling services.
        All statemachine activity is handled in the service calls.
    Data becomes xml which is persisted, etc.

Navigate to /Library/Tomcat.old/bin and do startup.sh.
Bring up browser and enter
	http://localhost:8080/qServer to get the demo app
	enter banking/banker to get the banking demo
	and sql/sql to get the sql demo.  (just like banking, but different color)
I need one called FAQ and a kb for it.
	also what questions can I ask the banking one?
Need to provide a way to bring up the intro at the bottom of the default
	and put the answer there.
Also, provide a logo and header with branding


---20130128 16:54:20
Fixed so that http://localhost:8080/qServer will bring up question page
    and if logged in with banking/banker or sql/sql will have two
    different look and feels and allow a question, returning the answer.
    At this time the kb isn't any good.  So the answer is no answer.
    Also started on ConsistencyChecker Action for freemind.
    Checked that pcpi runs on Parallels under pcpi vm.
    The qServer runs under Tomcat.old/5.5...
    IAskQue also runs at http://localhost:8080/
    Seems to be pretty intact.  Install on barsoom?

Completed expense report for January and mailed to Jim Donnelly and copies
    Dianne.
Printed out the DOE report from Charles, signed, and mailed to DOE.
Created a copy of FreeMindArchiver in Jet using VMFusionWare Windooze
    It ran fine on my VMs, but the packaged version wouldn't start
    and the executable, which ran fine, did not run at VISN8 since
    it did not have the Jet installer.  Have to package for it to run.
    Will have to redo and find out why the installer version won't run.
    It says it cannot do FreeMindMain Mode.
    Perhaps create a different start point?  One that doesn't do the
    Starter to Main, etc.?
Updated my VMFusionWare and Parallels and installed tools in them to share
    files with mac.  Only sharing PC_Share and Public

Made some changes in freemind to fix problems of mm_log as it was
    statically using the jwooten37830.com database server.
    Also fixed a couple of places where it could fail better.
    Installed and copied mm_prod.sql and mm_log.sql and sourced
    them into mysql.
    Tested running from the CST/Installations/freemind.bat and it worked!
    Sent notice to Chris and others.

---20130206 17:30:51
Created NetBeans projects for StateMachineWS, StateMachineWSJSPClient,
    TaskListWS, TaskListWSClient.
    These were deployed and return xml ( in a SOAP envelope? )
    to a jsp index.jsp.  The xml is correct and I created a
    set of testHTML.xml for the xml returned so that I could put
    the proper xsl at the top with <head> etc.  It then 
    displays the xml as a table as I want.

    However, when I try to take the data and transform it in the jsp
    it gives me the values in result, but no formatting?  Also, a problem
    on getting the "output" which is a var into the html pieces.


---20130208 22:09:41
TaskListWSClient demonstrates using two web services to create
    the home page ( home.jsp ), using two xsl sheets, one to style
    the tasklist (tasklist.xsl), and the other to layout the nav
    (applications.xsl).  The test_user1.css colors and fonts, while
    home.css positions the elements.

---20130209 17:22:56
Checked in current NetBeans WS projects.  Have home.jsp working with
    some behavior and moving to jQuery for handling page events.
    Had to let go of SkinServer for now.  Will revisit.
    Background is not yet right, but Applications drop down and a few
    others appear to be working.
    Now, to add the dequeue an entry and get it's jsp, and data
    back to the browser using xslt, jsp, and the xml data.
    If action gets a list or such, then it is packed into xml ( or json)

Got Glassfish version of TaskListWSClient working viz:

	a)  Home shows the tasklist.
	b)  The second row( currently ) has an activity that I have checked
		and it essentially dequeues it by sending the information
		to the StateMachineService and asks for the Activity
		It get xml with the state name, jsp name, buttons, etc.
		It also gets ( later ) the data uri from the queueEntry
		and returns xml with the data encapsulated.
		All gets laid out using css file.
	c)  Next step is to get the form name and dataUri from the queue
		entry and tie that end up.
	d)  Fix fonts, remove borders, apply backgrounds, etc. using
		css and jquery items in my Evernote.

To determine the number of samples for a C% confidence level and
    a E% max error rate, S = log(1-C)/log(1-E).  IF no errors found
    in the S samples, then the error rate is less than E% to a C%
    confidence level.  So, 1000 items, no more than 20 errors at
    95% confidence gives S = log(1-.95)/log(1-.02) = 148 ( roughly )

If you know the number of sample being taken, then
    the maximum number of errors in the population is
    E = 1-(1-C)^(1/S).  So, for C = .95, and S = 148,
    then E = 1 - .05^(1/148) = .02 => .02*1000 = 20, QEF
    That means that if you found no errors in the 148 samples
    then there are less than 20 errors in the 1000 population to the
    95% confidence level.

Got QueueMonitor working roughly in sc_demo (GlassFish).
    Need to add timer to it and reset to TaskListWS to
    reset time to Now + increment and leave WAITING.  QueueMonitor
    will reset if if the time expires.
    Put the Reset timer and button on activities.jsp
Create Dispatcher in sc_demo
    Move web page stuff from TaskListClient into sc_demo
    and use dispatcher to get too and from jsps.

---20130222 17:02:47
Got the QualityPanel factored out, coming up, doing statistics.
    Next, have it create the list of rows to check
    then get the matching tree elements using the genericId
    and print out the pairs as HTML
Got timer added to QueueMonitor and working.  Also created method
    to retain a row.  This might be moved to TaskListWS as a service
    and return either "RETAINED" or "FAILED: User xxx now has ownership"
    in xml, of course.  Create test page with updating progress bar, etc.

---20130225 20:16:22
Got sc_demo working with home.jsp refreshing every 10 seconds correctly
    and activity.jsp showing timer and right aligned text.
    Next is to add the advance behavior to the next state.
    CVS from NetBeans is not saving TaskListService or StateMachineService
    but I have manually imported them.  ***TODO*** check that they
    are in the local CVS repository.

---20130226 17:24:02
Got the sc_demo working with LoginEventHandler.  Revised header.jsp
    to expect a token string.
    Still need to get activity creating the string with the right data.
    Think I can do that after the service has responded.
    Careful to use same names when creating the token string.
    Next will do the authentication in the AuthenticationService
    as called from the AuthenticatingEventHandler.

---20130309 22:38:37
Removing all references in sc_demo to _application where it did
    and app.getNotifier().... and changing to 
    Notifiable notfier = (Notifiable)env.getAttribute("notifier");
    BUT, notifier isn't in the environment sometimes.
    May have fixed it, but now I'm getting no server logging,
    and only part of the dispatcher log.  I don't see the notification
    messages, which I think means that the notifier isn't being
    found in the environment!  Do some testing on it.  Does
    it dump its guts correctly?  Am I getting things into env?

---20130314 22:41:25
Reset 15620 to ACTIVE, removed it's successor, and tried to set up
    so that moving to next activity will work correctly.
    Things to do are:
    a)  Trace where the current-job gets sent to the QueueManager via
        getting set in the environment.
    b)  Add Logging where the rollback occurs.
    c)  See if I can capture where the exception is thrown when the result
        returned is not correct, put up error message and return to 
        home.jsp with eror.  (Don't barf on the persons page!)

Start new Employee, enter data, move to createUser.  Data for person
is persisted and available to createUser.  However, the queue entry
for createPerson should have been marked completed when data entered
and moved to createUser.  That isn't happening.  Fix logging and fix.

---20130415 11:43:02
Apparently new employee fills in data, then oid changes before marking,
so createPerson oid is still active, and that oid ends up being passed
to createUser.  Probably how it gets the right data.  Pass it as the data?

---20130416 17:03:34
Got start, advance, dequeue all showing data correctly.

Got validation working with nice form labels ( in field ) for login.jsp
Backed up sc_demo to sc_demo_20130521.zip since things sometimes get
screwed up without warning.  Found nice article on validation
that using validator in the field so it might work well with xml
from the state model.  It has a standard validator in the header
for the activity.jsp, for instance.  Put it into Evernote with tag field



---20130527 16:41:36
Added tablesorter javascript to ListCR.jsp and style sheets.
It now sorts and allows pagination, but some residual problems with
placement of the paginator when number of rows changes, and that
the 1 to 20 of 50 does not show at all.
Also, the sort arrows are too close to the text in the headers in small rows.
Maybe set their width?

Added drilldownmenu.js and drilldownmenu.css to _js and _css and backone.jpg to images ( copy to _images )
Added  jquery.treeview to sc_demo for evaluation. ( provides cookie persistence )


---20130625 12:16:23
Why isn't current_job showing up at top of activity.jsp?
Why does the alert about show process show up instead of jumping to
new workflow-view.jsp?  No reference to show process ... alert in project.

Send note to Legacy Reserves, viz.
It has been over a year since we made a trip to Pampa where I met with Johnny Russell, the production supervisor of the Pampa area for Legacy Reserves operations who currently owns the oil and gas drilling rights for the property.  His office is 1 mile from the property which is described as: SEC 139 BLK 31 & GN 160 AC ABST 452 NE/4.
He mentioned that he only has the rights to drill into the dolomite layer. Legacy Reserve's lease agreement probably refers to the 1962 Phillips Unit Agreement, of which I have a copy, that defines the Unitized Formation to be the "subsurface portion of the dolomite formation encountered in the interval 3,133 feet to 3,315 feet". Those drilling rights granted to Philips have been bought and sold numerous times and finally to Legacy Reserves.  To the east and west of the property this dolomite layer drops off to 12,000 feet.  This indicates that our property lies over a "dome", which is of obvious interest to oil producers.  Due to its shallowness, Mr. Russell would like to drill below that into the granite wash formation and perhaps lower. He does not, however, have the rights to do so. In fact he wondered if the owners even own the mineral rights at that lower level. To the best of our knowledge we definitely do own all rights to all levels and have leased out the rights to the dolomite level.
Should we be seeking another party that might have interest in drilling below the dolomite level?  We've received no interest from Legacy as to it acquiring those rights.
We were also told on our visit that production would be increasing and we would receive quarterly "reports", but have received nothing.

This is a very interesting time for those of us who have owned this property for generations.  We would appreciate more information and aggressiveness in this area.

Changed to sc_demo and added lots of try catches so that I could
find out what was happening.  
Notes:
    Must currently have a <prerender> for each state!  fails if not.
    The use of "Quit" as an event name causes the item to be queued!
        Not sure if this is as it should be.  Perhaps handle it
        via the actionLibrary instead.  i.e. Quit just does exit or such
    It appears that substituting noop for abandonProcess causes an error
    but they are the same code.  Perhaps being caught in code like quit?

 grep site ( which filters out all but the first line )
The TestDmeHelp program will send a notifiation via Growl if the server
is not running.  That copies to Prowler on my phone!
If I get the message, ssh barsoom, then tcu will start the server.
Now to creat this on the server so I don't have to monitor from my laptop.
