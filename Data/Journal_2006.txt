---20060113

	1)  Deploy new sc_framework.jar to tomcat 4.x/webapps/sc_app/web-inf/lib and new bin files for servlet.  Can't located mysql.Driver class.
If mysql jar in classpath, sc_app fails to load.

	2)  United Airlines Frequent Flyer # 01260098272/random1/Home

	3)  Do some testing of using mysql from Eclipse to verify setup okay, then determine how to use from Tomcat.

	4)  Set up simple tasklist in eclipsercp!
		Perspective:  workflow
		View: Tasklist
		have tabs for tasklist, jobs, etc. from admin.  Switching
		tab creates event.

	5)  DBProperties is attempting to use aim.properties instead of
		getting data from config.
		Add dbUrl jdbc:mysql:///queue_db
		    jdbcDriver com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
		and databaseUserid root

		to config under the QueueEntry or such and get from DBProperties.


---20060114

	1)  All tests in queue.db worked.  Some evidence that the cleanup didn't go smoothly, but that was in getting and deleting entries.
	Check this out!

	2)  sc_tests has the mysql connector bin.jar in it's path and works with the aim.properties file.  Shouldn't have to change that.

	3)  Where to put the connector file from 3rd party libraries so
	Tomcat will pick it up and not barf?  *** DONE ***


---20060115

	1)  Got sc_app to come up, but had to modify driver code etc. in 
		jsps.
	2)  Rewrite UserPrefs and header.jsp so that the header uses a 
		java class that gets its configuration from the config
		file and uses the same dburl, etc.  That way only
		change it once in config or aim.properties (for now).
		 *** TODO ***
	3)  Correct all jsps to refer to new location of Environment.
		Somehow user prefs says no connection ( might be problem
		with database there ).
	4)  Gather metrics and do report.
	5)  Contact re CPRS-R
	6)  Contact re VPN.
	7)  Applications isn't showing up all processes!

	3)  Need to add a new view of the queue at the bottom of the page.
	4)  Need to add clicking on queue item bringing up editor window.

	5)  Mantis had stopped working after creating database for user preferences.  Had to go back and create symbolic link ln -s  /var/mysql/mysql.sock /tmp/mysql.sock
	Then Mantis works and sc_app works.
	Still have problems with the preferences and divs. *** TODO ***

		WFDWY-XQXJF-RHRYG-BG7RQ-BBDHM
	2)  Product Key for Mac MS office
		FGBR4-FJWTG-D42CC-9H9QD-RV6HG
	3)  Installed Visio-2003, found that it erased keys for PC Office!
		reinstalled them from Office Premium SR-1 premium disk in 
			home office.
	4)  Reviewed LL1, etc. and sent vision files to Jim and Doug with
		note.  Copied Tom.
	5)  Converted file to xml (vxd from vsd proprietary ) and read
		into OmniGafflePro.  Looks very good!
 

---20060204

	1)  Got tableview working in ecp.  Lots of extra code.
		refactor so that viewer and label provider
		both use a factory that obtains the type of layoutProvider
		from the config file for "tableview=class,xxx.xml" or such.
		Then it loads the class that does the layout, i.e. TableLayout
		and reads in the xxx.xml file which contains
		<layouts>
		   <layout>
			<name>Tasks</name>
			<type>Table</type>
			<class>QueueEntry</class>
			<columns>
				<column id="0" label="Label" width="100"
					method="getEntryNumber"
					sorter="compare class" />
				....
			</columns>
		   </layout>
		</layouts>

	2)  Make sure that appname is specified as the queueName! and
		that a stepName and processname are entered.

	3)  Change so that clicking on the process name under the application starts up the application and uses a generic page where the current editor screen is going. ( later use layout as above to format )
Also, clicking on a task causes it to get selected as with sc_app.  Use dbl click listener to do action.  Add a right mouse listener to bring up full new dialog where one can look at history, diagram, etc.

	4)  How to add another tab where the taskList is?

	5)  Can I refactor to get rid of the register, etc. and 
		instead use the environment passed around?

	6)  CVS still isn't working correctly.  Can't save stuff.

	7)  Downloaded middlegen and middlegen Ide.  Doesn't seem to work.
		How does it know where ant and hibernate are?

	8)  Downloaded jboss and placed in /Library.  How to add ears?

workflow modeler, and engine.
		how to run, etc.?

	10)  Downloaded jbpm-gpd-site-3 which has features and plugins to install into Eclipse to do graphical modeling of state machines.  Should test in separate Eclipse installation.


---20060205

	1)  Created copy of rcp_ide as bpm_ide and installed features
		and plugins for bpm_ide.  Graphs look very nice.  xml
		is very similar.  Would really like to use this plugin
		but add inspecting and adding to graph nodes as in
		sc_wfeditor, and be able to generate either mode bpml or 
		my xml and documentation, etc.  I have a lot that this
		doesn't have, but their graphics look much better and
		the state machine may be better, although not sure about
		nested states yet.  Also doesn't have idea of elements,
		but that may be good.  Will continue to investigate to
		see what it takes to recreate sc_framework around this and
		perhaps incorporate a public domain rules engine and do
		xml based layouts.  *** TODO ***

	2)	Found cvs path for jBPM.  Access and get source code for
		designer!  *** TODO ***

	3)	Installed jbpm-starters-kit and tested starting jboss
		by cd'ing to jbpm-server and issueing 
			./bin/run.sh -c jbpm
		stop using ./bin/shutdown.sh -S in another window

		Note one appears to use a jboss deployer to put an ear or
			war into the jboss environment.


---20060206

	1)  Created NHLService.jws in Tomcat/webapps/axis and tested.
		it appears as a service.
	2)  Created TestNHLService.java in rcp_workspace/TestAxis/src/com/shoulderscorp/webservices
	3)  Need to create project and test this.  It is the client.
		*** TODO ***

	4)  Downloaded new axis and samples as well as Httpclient.

		Need to test HttpClient

	5)  PostXML under the HttpClient might be a way to send
		the XML containing a SOAP request to a SOAP client and get
		back XML with the response?

	6)  Also Look ath NHLServiceClient working with NHLService under Axis.
	7)  Create a QueueService and a QueueServiceClient to test
		QueueService takes arguments necessary to get queueList
		and QueueServiceClient creates those to test.
		QueueService has method getList(args) returns an array
			of QueueEntries?
		*** TO DO ***

	8)  Created VHAPlan.spp and VHAPlan.csv for use in ProjectPlan.
	9)  Created VHAItems.xls with list of some important items
	10)  Send to Christine and Robert the list of contacts at
		Salt Lake City, Bay Pines, San Antonio, etc.
	11) Address of  Old Ebbitt Grill:
			675 15th St. NW, between F&G streets
			Exit Orange Line at McPherson, down 15th.


---20060207

	1)  Copied ecp and ecp_workspace and PortalDevelopment onto Software to get package names
		for email to Doug.  Also copied ecp into Documents.

		javascript library

	These were located under the source code control system in the following folder according to my notes.  We would want those for the End of Release 3.  We want no Domain Specific classes such as Carrier or Broker and nothing to do with Selectivity or Targeting.  These packages provide common functionality that is not domain specific but can be used for any domain that uses workflow, common services, etc.  This would be very appropriate for use in the VHA environment and should be considered to save us a lot of time and effort as several person centuries went into developing this, testing it, and verifying that it performed very well, was stable, flexible, and scaled very well.

	3)  Redo Gant chart or produce a "visual" showing evolution of
		VHA, with phases and some "bubbles" identified.


---20060216

	1)  Created and deployed a web-server QueueService that currently
		returns a 2D array of Strings[][] with each row being
		a queueEntry array of 7 items as strings.  Will try to create a taskEntry that is one of these or such.
		The client uses the userid and the status currently.  It should return anything queued to the userid OR the role.
		This can now be used in the RCP version and perhaps the
		web one also.  

	2)  Trying to use the Startup didn't work in the service.  Not sure why yet.  Could have been a database problem of not having the connector.  Need to investigate.

	3)  Need to alter queueEntry so that data is preserved in queue database using name/value pairs, allow nesting. i.e. id, name, type, value
		but an entry type can be like Person, then we have
		101, Person, Ref, 102   [Ref can be Class or Hash]
		102, Name, String, John
		102, Age, int, 63
		101, Addr, Ref, 103
		103, Street, String, 106 Crestview Ln.
		103, City, String, Oak Ridge
		101, Date, Date, 11/3/2005
		
	Now to retrieve 101's data, we get all with 101, giving
		Person -> 102
		Addr   -> 103
		Date   -> 11/3/2005
		others with 101

		Then we assemble a Person object or hash? taking values from
		the 102 reference and an Addr taking data from the 103 refs.  We'll use Hash for a Ref type or Class if it's a class.
		This should be able to be nested very deep.  An object can't be saved unless it reduces to strings, ints, floats, dates.

	Then the save data contains a data-ref number.  When requeueing, if the data is the same? just point to same data.

	Create GenericDataStore that handles the above.
		It has a get returning an Object ( Class or Map ),
		and a put that persists same.

---20060221

	1)  New sc_framework and sc_tags jars deployed and seem to work in 
		sc_app.  While the three applications show up, under HR,
		only the PerformReview process shows up.  Need to see why
		the other choices don't show up.  Like it has a problem
		in the loop putting up the list.  Clicking on Perform
		review started the process and brought up the page.  cancel
		left it in the queue looking okay.
	2)  Got both start process, advance, and dequeue working.  One
		problem was that the hasRole was WRONG.  Really should
		use the roles from the user where the handling is correct.
	3)  Doesn't show background color right, nor the handling of
		the "divs" apparently.  User preferences don't show up.
	4)  Have tested the queueService and now need to try it
		in the RCP.  Also the start and advance and dequeue
		for that could be written as services.  start would take
		an application and a process.
		dequeue would take the oid and use handleEvent with dequeue		and return a State object?  How do we get the one that has
		the data from the queue to us?
		advance would have an environment with new variables in 
		it, and an eventName like Submit.  Should return new 
		information from which to get the next state in the next
		application, etc.

	1)  Tables in mysql are:

		bugtracker

		dbase

			tree_table // original for tree.php

		entity_db
			attributes
			entity
			links
			selectors

		metrics_db
			people
			preferences
			selectors

		preferences_db // not used, probably should copy part of metrics_db to it, clean it up and use it for sc_app, rcp_app.
			people
			preferences
			selectors

		queue_db
			queue
			queueEntry
		test
			// empty, no tables
		users_db
			maaking_users // used in login running index.php
		vha
			data_dictionary // an add should check that data name is registered in data_dictionary.
			clinical_scalars // experiment to test adding/plotting

	2)  Going to try to create a clinical app that takes a veterans
		pid, and selects flow-sheet or table.
		Then selects kind of data to plot [BPS,BPD,WT] with
		check boxes.
		Then plots each in a stripChart on a time axis and labeled.
 


---20060302

	1) Got ClinicalDataService working except there is a problem with
		the rows and columns.  If I ask for 3 types of data
		it fills correctly, but if for 2 then 3rd is empty.
	2) Use the login to determine the config file to use.
		Does the browser use the one under the organization?
		It seems both should, but that means giving the
		organization up front.
	3)  Fix the display in rcp so that it uses the jsp name
		to look up the rcp page and the layout to use.
		e.g. generic.jsp=generic
		or   viewTableData.jsp=configurable,clinicalData.xml
		or   viewPlotData.jsp=configurable,plotData.xml ?
	4)  Create StripChart class to plot a strip,
		a clinicalData plot has StripCharts, one below another.

	1)  Modified rest of HR pages for web application (Environment)
	2)  Added an Organization field to login.jsp, BUT
		The login servlet does not handle this correctly yet.
		I need to add org to elements or use proper element
		in the jsp, and use the organization to get the
		configuration file.  This means delaying the startup
		until I get the login information, then doing startup if 
		not already done?  How to handle multiple organizations?
		***TODO***

		layout ( or fractionalLayout? ).

	6)  How to get values from queue entry when state is reconstituted.

		to date on creating the assets tree from the database.
		Some behavior not quite right, but closer.
	9)  http://localhost/~woo/vsdb/vsdb.html shows the users page as
		it is supposed to look.  /index.php shows the lawyers or
		suchs set of pages.
	10) http://localhost/~woo/vha/dumpdb.php dumps the patient clinical
		vital signs database.  It is created from mysql by
		sourceing the mysql_database.sql
	11) If you do http://localhost/~woo/login/index.php
		you see the login handler in php.  It needs new images
		to get rid of the crap there.  ***TODO***
	12) What is calcify?
	13) how to test, run, etc. ruby?
	14) 


---20060330

	1)  Start with VHA_Architecture Discussions.ppt under PC Share
		for SOA discussion.
		a)  Add picture of CBP architecture.
		b)  Give example of clinical data using services.
		c)  Discuss development being mostly about creating 
			actions which use services.  Most of what we've
			seen in VHA involves CRUD operations with
			data input and presentation.
		d)  Basic tenant of VHA is 

			CRUD
			Rich Presentation ( aggregated data )
				manipulatable
			role-based access, views, task servicing
			(decision support) 

			State 1
			   

			( aggregate action , if-then-else
				get data/put data
				get ref data
				decisions/filters/transformations )
			   

			State 2

	2)  Get key/authorization for TurboCad and enter.
	3)  Check out PlaySnd so that I can play a snd file from cmd
		line or an application via AppleScript.
	4)  Get gnuplot working!  ***TODO***
		installed AquaTerm, but gnuplot not seeing it.
		Where is fortune?
	5)  Got cache removed from auto startup.  Now run
		cache to start it from terminal and cache_stop to stop
		it.  csession cache -U vista starts vista.
	6)  Found that OpenBase was autostarting and had 5 databases
		open.  Removed it from /Library/StartupItems.
	7)  skins class not being found in sc_app


---20060331

	1)  Appears that elements for web come from different place than
		elements for rcp.  ***TODO*** add field to config
		that sets location of elements and be sure it uses
		it when it starts on web.
	2)  Look up the element name for the result!  put into clinicalData.xml  ***DONE***
	3)  Fix sc_app login page to use table. ***DONE***
	4)  Add Patient Info to top of Clinical Data page in web and rcp.
	5)  change textarea to label for description.
	6)  Fix clinicalData.jsp to get data from environment
		and the action to put it there!  ***TODO***
		Fix this in RCP also!!! ***TODO***

	7)  TurboCad Serial #: MB40-0555-1069-3627
		Registration#: ZCOMS-2276-7C69-4EAC-AAD0-FB5B-ACBD

	8)  Removed unnecesssary languages from Mac using Monolingual.app.
	9)  Checked that log pruning was working.  Apparently Anachron
		is working?  At least things get run regularly.
		How to auto prune application log files, tomcat log files,
		etc.  ***TODO***


---20060402

	1)  Create getDataTypes and getData as services in Axis and test
		then access via the actions!  Remove the fake data.

	2)  defaultConfigFile is hardwired into Startup!  ***TODO***
	3) Look at PerformReview/employeeInput to see if Environment is defined.
	4)  HR/Home/tasklist.jsp import seems to have a screw up?  Look at generated java file.
	5)  sc_app/SkinServer.jsp missing skins.UserProfileBean
	6)  presence of static variable for new Class in action
		causes it NOT to be performed.  
	7) Add sort to table columns in jsp for clinicalData. ***DONE***
		BUT, action not implemented.  After sorting, will the
		render cause it to just redo and not be sorted?
		Need to set flag about rendered.  If already rendered, then
		don't render again?  When leaving state, remove render flag?
	8) Can't get services OR direct access to work from rcp.  But works
		fine from web application.
	9)  Add Take Vitals as process to application.  Get patient ID,
		then get Types  entered and store those filled in in database with
		date.  ***TODO***  1 action will copy names, date, and values to a new array.
		need action to take 
		and save in database.  SaveClinicalData(pid, array of data)
       10)  Add a new Type process!  ***TODO***

	11) Downloaded and placed wz_jsgraphics.js into sc_app under Tomcat.  Really is a clever javascript plotting package.
	12) Created a TestGraphics.html there also to use it.
		Trying to get scaling, etc. working so I can do
		strip charts, multiple graphs per plot, legends, etc.
		Need to be able to create multiple strip charts for
		medical information.

		http://localhost:8080/sc_app/TestGraphics.html


	13)  Need to add the copyData to state model for flowSheet just
		like viewTable.


---20060403

	1)  serialized objects are kept in /tmp/databases/objects.

	2)  Had to make explicit references to axis and other libraries ni
		the libraries section of the application.  Makes sense
		since it doesn't run from the workspace where it would have
		relative references.
	3)  select BPD and flowsheet in rcp, get table of BPD.
		do same in tableview and get failure and all three types.
	4)  Downloaded AnyDVD, need to check with a DVD.  Then buy.
	5) 


---20060405

	1)  Plan to pay off Diannes Discover this month.  Check our planned expenses before doing this.  Only 1K reserves then.
	2)  Check which has highest interest, my discover or one of the other cards.  Update the interest rate part of my spreadsheet.
		Pay 3000 on the highest rate card? 
	3)  July would then allow another whack after pay increase
		and time to recover.   Looks like could pay 5K or so.
	4)  Pay Bill for Hot Tub.
	5)  Installed Darwin Ports.  Use by
		sudo port xxx
		Saved page under References.
		used to install AquaTerm, but AquaTerm isn't working right.
	6)  got fortune installed and working using port.
		Will check out others.
	7)  Checked and it appears that sc_app uses the directory located
		in the webapp setup parms.  Probably need to delay
		the environment until after we get the login organization
		and then get the elements for the environment using
		the organization and of course the user afterwards!
			***TODO***
		Alter LoginServlet, web.xml.
		Test WorkFlowEditor, sc_app, hyperbola so that
		they all can change configuration files! ***TODO***


---20060406
	
	1)  Write taxes on loan account. ***TODO***
	2)  Also HotTub ***TODO***  Damn!!!
	3)  rails isn't working for some reason.  expenses and findings
		suddenly give errors.

	2)  Add Mozart CDs some to IPod
	3)  Some work on the user object, etc.
	4)  Get MySQL working consistently with sc_app, etc.
	5) 


---20060427

	1)  sc_app now only runs VHA, not shoulders.
		The organization is not being used as it should be.
		CHECK THIS OUT and fix ***TODO***
 	


---20060430

	1)  To show all files/folders in Finder do:
Switch on full view, in the Terminal type:

defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE

killall Finder

	To revert back, type:

defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE

killall Finder


Set up automator action?

	2)  Have sc_app running Shoulders but choosing VHA doesn't make a 
		difference.  Also, logging out isn't removing session?
1. Open Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/).
2. Each of the following commands is preceded by the number sign (#), which represents the prompt you see on screen. Type each command, pressing Return before continuing to the next:

# sudo mysql_install_db --force
# sudo chown -R mysql:admin /var/mysql
# sudo chmod -R o- /var/mysql
# sudo safe_mysqld &
# sudo mysqladmin -u root password <new_pwd>


---20060501

	1)  Got to where we're using organization to do part of reading, BUT... After using VHA, then try Shoulders or vice-versa, then we have
	leftovers in the system.  login should make sure that the session
	is cleared?  Logout should definitely clear up also. ***TODO***
		***DONE*** But
	2)  If two browsers are open, then if we log in as VHA on one
		then as Shoulders on the other, when we refresh on the non-Shoulders one, it becomes a Shoulders one (if that's the last thing that happened).  Some state is being preserved!!! ***TODO***
	3) Removed StateMachineHelper as static and it now logs into separately, but when I execute a step then it is sych'd again.
	ApplicationContainer or other container is maintaining state.
		***TODO***  Go through all classes and look for statics
		and state maintaining code and remove.

	4)  1-877-674-2487 x 179310 conf call for shoulders
	5)  to run terrain mapping, cd to the bin directory there and
		execute
		java -classpath . -Xms1g -Xmx1g Main
		select the data that ends in txt

	6)  processes for woo don't show up all in client that show up in
		web.  Check how I verify what processes show up in client.
			***TODO***
		Add a logout?  switch to login screen?



---20060502

	1)  Noted that during the mysql fiasco, I had lost the vha database.
	Recreate using >source /Users/woo/Sites/vha/mysql_database.sql;
	2)  Add the hide tag to transistions and filter using them.
		It could also have an additional attribute "forRole".

	3)  Drink and Dinner with Yohan Sewant.  Talked to him about
		realities of 1099 versus employee.  Encouraged him
		to help us add people, he would be rewarded.  What we've 
		offered in the past, not sure how applies to 1099, but we'd
		find a way.


---20060524
	
	1)  Installed demo version of JIRA.  Should I buy a license
		and use mySQL database?
	2)  Spend more time with the Ruby On Rails.
	3)  JBoss of course.
	4)  DOI has expensive infrastructure, unreliable, with political 
		problems.  Twenty bureaus each with its own network and
		interconnection is a problem, multiple firewalls,
		committees, and legal constraints on who can connect
		to whom and how.  I.e. bureau of Indian Affairs etc.
	5)  Middlegen is a source code generation system for EJB's.

	1)  Sent Shoulders.zip with bp_workspace except for ThirdPartyLibraries to Hank and Keith Campbell.  It reads and writes
xml business processes that are very similar to bpel except that it uses an action library for the fine grained behavior.  Included the data manipulation but not really used.
	2)  Should consider having very small projects like this that share the core and having different workspaces where actual projects are done.
Have a separate one for wf_editor, one for rules, one for bp workflow servlets, etc.
	3)  Try to get the servlet version working again, but use notification to handle saving, etc. so that the queue mechanism, databases, etc. are disconnected.  I.e. when a transition takes place, a signal is sent that the transition is beginning, is sucessfully ending, etc.  Save queue data then if desired.  For real data that is to be persisted, save it via actions that are told the data element(s) and have a standard service.

Requires dataset in mysql called vha?
Log the exceptions in ClinikcalDataService.jws ( as java, convert back to jws and replace!)

Probably don't try to convert access db's to mysql ( well think about it as  a first step ).
But might look at creating some of the workflows with data fields, etc.
Then how to create the proper classes to encapsulate the data, then
use hibernate to create the tables in mysql.  taxdb.mdb might be an exception, whey recreate that, instead redesign the way the tables are used.
Should think, however about replacing that horrible 1,2,3 stuff with a more rule-based approach.  I.e. when tax calcs are started, we fire rules on the individuals in the bay batch to create a new grossToNet instance for each
individual ( let new GrossToNext (company, payid ) ) actually do this 
and from that have each grossToNext in iterator be told to do the
execute method?  Internally we have a set of event chains that are assembled somewhat like the "Q" network that fire to do the calculation.
Access is made via a service call to one or more TaxTable objects that supply the necessary data.

Fix mysql databases.  Try from mac to PC, export on PC, then import on Mac.

Denny suggests that it might be the css or style sheets since it works on the mac in Safari, but not in Explorer either on the mac or pc.

How to convert access database to mysql database along with data?

do on pc for nyc and move to mac.  Try.

Did backup of Bugtracker and metrics using mysql administrator into
	directory ~woo/Development/database_backups.  Name prefixes are
	for bugtracker and metrics.  Date and time are attached.


Downloaded some generic modem scripts and information on how to connect without having to use the extra cost data package with Sprint.  Started setting it up as 	

	

---20061015

Found that had to do

	sudo chmod -R data 777 on the data directory in /usr/local/mysql
		Then things were not read-only!

	Sure there is a security hole, but it works.

The dumpdb.php in vsdb had older syntax.  Could no longer
	use <? and ?> for instance or <?= $val ?>
	but instead used <?php and ?> and did a print with
	equals of the table rows.  Instead of 
	?><tr><td><?=$ID?></td></tr><?

	it became
	(still in php )
	print("<tr><td>$ID</td></tr>");

Also <td>isset($ID)</td> did't appear to print out right.  It printed out
	isset()

	So I created $val = isset($ID);
	and put $val inside the quotes to be evaluated.

Created a test_connect.php that is built off of the mantis stuff
	Will try to replace some of the explicit stuff in vsdb
	with a new test_dumpdb.php that requires test_connect.php
	to see if we can't make this simpler and get reuse out of the
	mantis approach.

Look at putting 10% of cash into FSMAX?  Others?

The three project categories that I created in Groove are: 
DFIEA IPACSI = Ramona = Dr. Marinkovich
DoD VA = Cathy = Col. Van Arsdel
CHDR = ?? = ?? 

In addition, I created a category "CITPO" for contract-wide content.


---20061016

	1)  Tested that generic "connect.php" would work with
		"test_dumpdb.php".  Connect.php uses config_inc.php
		to get general configuration information and ado_api.php
		to connect to the database.

		It is users responsibility to set table and do queries, etc.
		in their own code.

	They include "require_once("connect.php");
	
	at the beginning of their code ( see test_dumpdb.php ).

	2)  Went through parts of vsdb and found that assets_tree.php
		reproduces behavior of the vsdb.html page where the tree.js 
		somehow creates a tree and gives it behavior.
		Most of the app is a mock-up using html and static data.
		Appears that a lot of this should run in a portlet
		and as things are selected, they make other parts change?
		i.e. each portlet gets its data from the session on 
		who is the user, what folder was clicked, etc.?

	3)  mysource_matrix has lots of useful tools like tree that expands an xml file, etc.  It apparently is a content management system.

	4) several tables are missing in nyc.  column missing in prefs.


---20061018

	1)  Got JBoss IDE working again by doing ant build in directory to correct links.
	2)  Started JBoss server in server directory with
		./run.sh =-c jbpm
	3)  Tested using http://localhost:8080/jbpm

	4)  Added targets, but did not appear to be redeploying.
		Need to look up how this is done.

	5)  Would like to try to simulate a newHire etc. to see
		the workflow and create an employee.


---20061025

	1)  Look up more on managing JBoss deployed processes.
		Appears that the deployed instances don't match the 
		things that I see when I see the list of instances.
		E.g.  I see that ID=12 should be simple request vacation.
		I enter that ID and get a schedule review instead.
		Perhaps there are some newer administration and monitoring
		interfaces out there for JBoss JBPM.

	2)  Try to create something more like a new hire and see if I 
		can then substitute a web page from pcpi and then use
		hybernate to create the data structures?


---20061026

	1)  Review Symantec Web and Ontologies.  See if I can get Ralph
		invited to give a short seminar to Col Marinkovitch and
		a few of his people.  Gave him my briefing on it and its'
		use.  We also discussed VHA and MHS, differences, 
		successes, common problems, approaches, etc.  Discussed
		problems of FAA and similarity of issue there.  Both are
		hard, but part of the problem may be that they both are
		trying to solve the wrong problem.  FAA is trying to assist
		the controller, perhaps it should be trying to assist
		the pilot!  MHS is not patient centric, perhaps that should
		be questioned.  I made statement that it is often the
		unquestioned assumptions that are at the root of the
		problem!  

	2)	xferred 5K from money mkt ira to contra fund.

	3)	no balance on car!  $22.83 refund.  Will post to bank in 2-3 days.  Was received on 25th.  


---20061031

	1)  Scheduled payoff on large loan for this afternoon.  Paid $12 for immediate pay because 1 day costs $15 in interest!
	2)  Scheduled Discover bill for end of Nov ( 11/20/2006 ).
	3)  Xferred $2500 to Brokerage account.  Check Diannes
		SSN and other information.
	4)  Need to start Tomcat and check out webapps I have on mac.
		plus check the port 80 ones.  Make list of corrections
		prioritize and start.
	5)  Start jbpm from bin directory of server with
		./run.sh -c jbpm ( I think ) and then
		http://localhost:8080/jbpm
		to start the workflow server.  Check out the admin panel
		etc. to see what could be improved.
		Create workflow that changes role!  Create
		a sample ED workflow, then try to get it to work
		from a java program that throws events at it!!  I'll have
		to write a monitor program that takes a message or polls
		for a file with a message or such and displays a "panel".
		The workflow will create the message when it changes state.
		Perhaps use the notification part I've used before.
		How to combine jbpm and the Notification?
		Perhaps create smaller package that provides the adaptable or extensible interface and the Notification and Notifier interface?

	6)  Added diagram from installation package for IDS called
		BHIE Architecture_061031 that shows SHARE client
		being used to get information from CHCS.  What is role of 
		ALTA client and SHARE?  Describe a senario or use-case.
		Modified IDSD6000, Pt1 with lots of comments.  Transcribe
		into spreadsheet and forward commented document to Cathy.


---20061101

	1)  bankofamerica.com to reset passcode.
	2)  Met with Col Lacy of SGR in AirForce, Justin (?),
		and Col Marinkovitch about ICDB and DFI cooperation.
		Appears that ICDB would work for CITPO to do a lot
		of what DFI does.  Need to work on managing of reference
		versus diagnostic images.  SGR needs capability to do
		ad hoc retrieval of images sometimes for global work load
		leveling, while users of ALTHA need mostly reference if
		not on site or at PACs viewer, but can move PACs images
		to another region if they have advance notice.  Not clear 
		on total reasons here, but SGR thinks it has enough
		bandwidth, while Col M doesn't think so.  So try to combine
		It appears Lacy has money for part of this.

		He also favors web application and if browser were
		imbedded in ALTHA, then ALTHA could use the browser based
		navigation system that SGR is building?  so could Vista
		when they complete the installation of a browser in
		CPRS-R.
- 1PM.

	2)  0900-1000 IDS mtg, review status.
		I mentioned to Col. Arsdel about our meeting with
		Col. Lasek JSR and his desire to work together with
		Col. Marinkovitch on imaging.  Col. Arsdel ( who was at
		Wright Patterson Air Force Lab ) said to coordinate with
		Dave Schrader and let him be aware.  He is very interested
		in these joint projects.  I will inform Col. Marinkovitch.
		There is also an El Paso deliverable soon on imaging
		as there was an IPR last week. Not clear how all these
		different projects are related.

		Col Arsdel was amazed that the budgeting process,
		continuing resolutions, etc. operated like this.
