Gave demo to Col xxx of AIA this morning.  He appeared interested.  Said he
would provide some money to support "me" in some data fusion work.  Wasn't too
concerned about $1 million tag on Thinking machine for prototype, but
perked up when I mentioned work on $5K version (He wants lots in the field).
He was interested in scanning and in retrieval with simple interfaces.  Ron
reported that some money might be coming from him.

Also helped Bob Sanders prepare a chart for Ron about ACISO budget.

Copied down f2c but will wait until version 2.0 to install it .

Input info from Ron Shipe TVA into prop.tex with margin notes.  Spoke to 
J. Shrago.  She will send her comments.  Likes new document.  I gave her ball

Lunch with Gary Lancaster of IBM, brief discussion of new IBM developments 
and workstations high performance interests.  Discussed Paris switch and RIOS 
super computer donations by IBM to set up ORNL Classroom of the 21st Century.

---19910409 14:04:19
called Charles perky.  change of banks should not affect trust.  Estate trust
to be closed out soon (1-2 days). He will contact me about income familiar
trust could generate asap.

---19910410 17:15:12
downloaded some classes, a time sound speaker, and a QuickPlot routine
Also gnuplot now works, although the Latex documents don't print with diagrams
yet.

---19910422 14:25:17
Added a makefile for latex to lib and tested it in TeX/memos
Got most of a distribution list working.  Numbering of single copies really
seems screwed up.  Numbering sometimes seems random.  I sent message to
LaTeX guru to try to understand.

---19910917 16:55:12
Loaned book on Strategic Planning to Dennis Clark.

---19911017 16:31:41
Fixed version of wargames.
Downloaded gnuplot3.0, problem may be HUGE -DNeXT?
	Upgrade to version 2.1 asap.
FrontEnd can't figure out where window is for csh.  Want to
	put it into a panel and add a button to get help.

---19911104 17:08:48
Worked with McGaffey and found a way to create a table and then read it
back in.  Also started testing using RCS as a way to store and maintain
TeX files.  Haven't found out how to get the comments out or how to
automatically include author name etc yet.

---19911106 09:39:53
changed /usr/adm/weekly to trim the log files in /usr/local/adm also.
I probably need to mail myself a message monthly regarding disk space and
sizes of log files, particularily large ones!

---19911106 15:03:11
added dwrite Terminal Shell "/NextApps/Terminal" to defaults so that Gopher
would have something to read.  If I have problems with this later like
automatically trying to access that node "wais" then what to do? 

---19911108 10:43:22
Ftp's to kum.kaist.ac.kr for sicstus, a version of prolog.  Haven't been 
able to get it to compile yet.  There was a lot of other stuff like
smalltalk, scheme, Xlisp, etc. there also.  Will have to explore that
archive more.

Also started having problems with NeXT version of WWW.  Unix version
doesn't access WAIS correctly, could be problem with telnet again? NeXT
version just dies!

---19911108 16:46:11
added header information to all *.c and *.h files in ~/project/nextdb.
Need to finish with Makefile, nextdb_main.m, etc.
Add Variable $Version$ to the startup so code will print its version.
Also add to each routing so that on debug each module would print its version?

---19911111 11:58:45
Gave lecture at Claxton Elementary about networking.  They are really
excited about possibilities.  Superintendent was there also.  
Gave infor on OREN to Bill Burris at OR school bldg.  Also loaned him
the laser disk of Jasper Woodbury and the video tape for about 2 weeks.

---19911113 11:59:46
Wrote dir2tex which outputs a directory "tree" as #include files
for tex manual.  the directory is assumed to be a tree structured
help file, include files, doc files, etc.  Still needs final work.

Also George Dailey called and will pursue my transfer for Dec 1.

---19911114 08:17:33
Located example of finger piped to fgrep of set of users which looks
interesting.  I copied it and named it peek in my ~/bin area.

---19911114 10:30:34
ftp nnsc.nsf.net anonymous nsfnet find macintosh hypercard stacks
tour of the internet and binhex file tour...  k-12 teaching tool.

---19911115 08:24:41
Post to comp.lang.prolog a request for sbprolog functions that are missing.
(Look up which ones they are first).

---19911118 09:12:26
Modified watch on sacam to allow demo1 to run.  Will mail message to 
me if anyone else logs in.

---19911118 10:41:28
Downloaded corewars, cutpas, BerkleyProlog, phoon, snobol4, starchart from
apple.com.  phoon abends with bus error.  cut and paste seem to compile
correctly.  Installed man pages in local/man.  May have deleted cat1?
Moved cut* and paste* to ~/bin.  Moved getopt.c to ~/src. Have to think about
snobol4 some more.  Starchar seems to work but needs 4 arguments.  Run
planet - to generate planet.star, then starpost -RA -DC -VW "title" > test.ps
where RA and DC are centered on planet you want to see.

---19911118 13:25:03
trying to compile Berkley Prolog, trouble using cc++ finding library functions.

---19911118 13:41:12
get an out of core when trying basic from apple.com.  compiled using
m68000 makefile?

---19911118 14:03:03
Problem in phoon with twslib.a.  twscopy is giving bus error.  Why?

---19911119 09:11:05
Added fopen("/dev/tty","r") to the coder.  It allows crypt key to be entered
from the terminal.  I'll look up now how to prevent it echoing to the terminal.
Problem exists however if the message is longer than the key.  Fix this soon.

---19911202 10:07:33
Greg sent me a sumex shell script for repeatly polling ftp site until file
transfer is sucessful.  I put it into ~/bin.  It needs a file.in
that probably has user, pass, and cd to directory then set binary
and get file(s).  this could be improved I think.  Work on it later.
